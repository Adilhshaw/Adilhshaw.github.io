Milton undertook to destroy the effect of this dangerously popular work, with its sentimental, idealizing picture of the King, and in (&quot;the Image-breaker&quot;), published in October, 1649, he produced a stinging attack on the royal character as revealed in </span><span class="c3">Eikon Basilike</span><span class="c7">. Breaks Bishop Gauden&rsquo;s image of a saint with a tyrant. He begins thus: &ldquo;To descant on the misfortunes of a person fallen from so high a dignity, who hath also paid his final debt both to nature and his faults, is neither of itself a thing commendable, nor the intention of this discourse&quot; and then attacks his character. He says that the book supposed to be his autobiography was a plagiarism of Sidney&rsquo;s </span><span class="c3">Arcadia</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;and to think a man in his hours of death would take recourse to such an amorous book (while it has its merits but not when the hour demands religious devotion) itself talks of his character. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c8">3 Defences</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3">Defence of the English People</span><span class="c7">&nbsp;(1651) Latin title: </span><span class="c3">Joannis Miltoni Angli pro Populo Anglicano Defensio contra Claudu anonymi, alias Salmasii, Defensionem Regiam.</span><span class="c7">&nbsp;He replied to </span><span class="c3">Defensio Regia</span><span class="c7">&nbsp;</span><span class="c3">pro</span><span class="c7">&nbsp;</span><span class="c3">Carolo</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;written by French Claude Saumaise, generally known as Salmasius, commissioned by exiled Charles II as against regicide.

After more cannibals arrive to partake in a feast, Crusoe and Friday kill most of them and save two prisoners (including Friday&rsquo;s father). A plan is devised wherein the Spaniard would return to the mainland with Friday&#39;s father and bring back the others, build a ship, and sail to a Spanish port. However, an English ship appears aboard which the crew had a mutiny; Crusoe and the ship&#39;s captain strike a deal in which Crusoe helps the captain and the loyal sailors retake the ship. Later, the mutineers take up Crusoe&#39;s offer to remain on the island rather than being returned to England as prisoners to be hanged.&nbsp; Crusoe leaves the island on 19&nbsp;December 1686 and arrives in England on 11&nbsp;June 1687.&nbsp; He learns that his family believed him dead; as a result, he was left nothing in his father&#39;s will.

On the way to the mainland once again from Crusoe&#39;s island, the ship is attacked by the cannibals.

Then the Prince&#39;s wife (the Princess) become ill and dies and he now leaves mistress out of repentance. Returns to England.

The Jew recognized the jewels as being the ones which had been allegedly stolen from an English jeweller many years prior. He schemes to take it; but she evades the Jew with merchant&rsquo;s help. Has a child with merchant but doesn&rsquo;t want to marry. She becomes a great hostess in England where she becomes famous for her parties and the Turkish dress she wears and the Turkish dance the slave taught her.

Her reputation as a mistress and a whore tires her, and she wishes to lead a simpler life.

Susan&#39;s motives to have her mother recognize her as her daughter are unclear. Nevertheless, Roxana feels threatened, and Amy proposes to murder her. The novel ends on ambiguity as to whether Amy actually kills Susan. Roxana only laments the crime that has tainted her life, strongly suggesting Susan was murdered for Roxana to retain her status and reputation. </span><span class="c8 c4 c1">The text ends on an &quot;unfinished&quot; note, with Roxana living in wealth with her husband in Holland, but assuring the reader that events eventually bring her low and she repents for her actions and experiences a downturn in fortune.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4 c1 c7">Captain George Carlton</span><span class="c8 c4 c1">&nbsp;(1728)</span></p><h3 class="c19"><span class="c8 c9 c24">Jonathan Swift (Irish) (1667-1745) &nbsp;&quot;Dean Swift&rdquo;, Irish</span></h3><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&nbsp;Dean&nbsp;of&nbsp;St Patrick&#39;s Cathedral, Dublin.

Bolingbroke helped Swift with the book&#39;s composition. Discusses government&#39;s case for a unilateral peace with France; attack the previous Whig government and justify the appointment of a&nbsp;Tory&nbsp;ministry in 1710. Swift&#39;s&nbsp;anti-war&nbsp;and anti-Whig arguments captured parliamentary and popular opinion.&nbsp;The government subsequently signed the&nbsp;Peace of Utrecht.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4 c21 c1 c7">The Windsor Prophecy</span></p><p class="c25"><span class="c2 c1"><a class="c0" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://archive.org/details/aproposalforcor00swifgoog/page/n3/mode/2up&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1736319647328559&amp;usg=AOvVaw3qubqOw6VwHGNeXk4XEp9U">&quot;A Proposal for Correcting, Improving and Ascertaining the English Tongue&quot; (1712)</a></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4 c1 c7">Proposal for Universal Use of Irish Manufacture</span><span class="c8 c4 c1">&nbsp;(1720)</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c8 c4 c1">&quot;A Letter of Advice to a Young Poet&quot; (1721)</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4 c1 c7">Drapier&#39;s Letters</span><span class="c8 c4 c1">&nbsp;(1724)</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4 c1">&quot;Cadenus and Vanessa&quot; (1726) poem written on &nbsp;</span><span class="c2 c1"><a class="c0" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esther_Vanhomrigh&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1736319647329080&amp;usg=AOvVaw20f9eq9hfhtTMmqP3HZxbD">Esther Vanhomrigh</a></span><span class="c4 c1">, contains in its title an anagram and a neologism:&nbsp;</span><span class="c4 c1 c7">Cadenus</span><span class="c4 c1">&nbsp;is an&nbsp;</span><span class="c2 c1"><a class="c0" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anagram&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1736319647329303&amp;usg=AOvVaw0T1eWwPzRpdcGOzWvz1Kts">anagram</a></span><span class="c4 c1">&nbsp;of the Latin&nbsp;</span><span class="c2 c1 c7"><a class="c0" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decanus&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1736319647329438&amp;usg=AOvVaw02RzdkcYRfV6VnJbo21l6f">decanus</a></span><span class="c4 c1">, meaning &#39;dean&#39;.

Book II centres on the highly scatological &quot;heroic games&quot; to celebrate coronation. The first game is for booksellers.

The phantom poet is named More, a reference to&nbsp;</span><span class="c2 c1"><a class="c0" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Moore_Smythe&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1736319647354804&amp;usg=AOvVaw1saT4nkqjqgOdCFDW9hv6i">James Moore Smythe</a></span><span class="c1 c11">, who had plagiarised both Arbuthnot (</span><span class="c1 c11 c7">Historico-physical Account of the South-Sea Bubble</span><span class="c1 c11">) and Pope (</span><span class="c1 c11 c7">Memoirs of a Parish Clark</span><span class="c1 c11">), and whose only original play had been the failed&nbsp;</span><span class="c1 c11 c7">The Rival Modes</span><span class="c1 c11">.

The next contest is for authors, and it is the game of &quot;tickling&quot;: getting money from patrons by flattery. Another contest, primarily for critics, comes next. In this, Dulness offers up the prize of a &quot;catcall&quot; and a drum that can drown out the braying of asses to the one who can make the most senseless noise and impress the king of monkeys. The critics are then invited to all bray at the same time. In this, Richard Blackmore wins easily (&quot;Everlasting Blackmore&quot;). Book three is set in the Temple of Dulness in the city. Theobald sleeps with his head on the goddess&#39;s lap, with royal blue fogs surrounding him.&nbsp;Settle gives Theobald full knowledge of Dulness. In the fourth boo, Colly Cibber is attacked.

They conclude that the match may be more profitable to the Peachums if the husband can be killed for his money. They leave to carry out this errand. However, Polly has hidden Macheath. Macheath goes to a tavern where he is surrounded by women of dubious virtue: among them Jenny Diver, Suky Tawdry who contracted with Peachum to capture him. He is now a prisoner in Newgate prisonrun by Peachum&#39;s associate, the corrupt jailer Lockit. His daughter, Lucy Lockit, has the opportunity to scold Macheath for having agreed to marry her and then broken this promise. She tells him that to see him tortured would give her pleasure. Macheath pacifies her, but Polly arrives and claims him as her husband. &nbsp;Macheath tells Lucy that Polly is crazy. Lucy helps Macheath to escape by stealing her father&#39;s keys. &nbsp;Polly visits Lucy to try to reach an agreement, but Lucy tries to poison her. Macheath now finds that four more pregnant women each claim him as their husband. He declares that he is ready to be hanged. The narrator (the Beggar), notes that although in a properly moral ending Macheath and the other villains would be hanged, the audience demands a happy ending, and so Macheath is reprieved, and all are invited to a dance of celebration, to celebrate his wedding to Polly. Beggar&#39;s last remark: &quot;That the lower People have their Vices in a Degree as well as the Rich, and are punished for them.&quot;</span></p><ol class="c17 lst-kix_list_10-0" start="7"><li class="c3 c5"><span class="c9 c11">&nbsp;</span><span class="c6 c11">Polly </span><span class="c9 c11">(1777) its sequel.</span><span class="c1 c11">&nbsp;Was banned by Lord Chamberlain, so only in print.

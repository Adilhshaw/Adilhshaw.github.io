Squire B. &nbsp;But for a wealthy man to do no wrong is being virtuous.</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c11">Considered one of the first true English novels. Pamela Andrews (15 years old) works for Lady B as a maid in her Bedfordshire estate. Dies and Mr B becomes master who first gifts her his mother&#39;s fine clothes, and then attempys &nbsp;to seduce her. In one instance, she faints, and finds the laces of her stays have been cut. She confides in her best friend and housekeeper of the estate, Mrs. Jervis. Later, Mr. B hides in Pamela&#39;s closet and tries to kiss her when she undresses for bed, which causes Pamela to consider leaving her position and returning to her parents to preserve her innocence. But deferes to finish embroidering a waistcoat for him. Mr. B informs Pamela that he intends to marry her off to Mr. Williams, his chaplain in Lincolnshire. Decides to leave; Mr. B intercepts her letters to her parents and tells them she is having an affair with a poor clergyman and that he will send her to a safe place to preserve her chastity. Pamela is forcibly taken to Mr. B&#39;s Lincolnshire Estate by Mr. B&#39;s servant Monsieur Colbrand, where she begins a journal with the intention of sending it to her parents. Housekeeper is Mrs. Jewkes. She communicates with Mr. Williams by letters who sees Jewkes beat Pamela and gets villagers to help her but they support Mr. B. William proposes marriage but is beaten and robbed. Attempts to escape but is terrified by two cows, which she mistakes for bulls. Williams&#39;s correspondence revealed and Mr. B decides to marry her to a servant. B offers her to be his mistress. In league with Mrs. Jewkes, Mr. B molests Pamela while she is in bed and is dressed as the housemaid Nan. She grows hysterical and about to die; he repents. Mr. B implies that he loves Pamela but will not marry her because of her social status. A parcel of letters seized by Jewkes is read by B. who grows sympathetic to her. He lets her return home. Vol. 2: He apologises in letter. When she hears that he is ill, she returns to him. In love; get married. William also released from prison. One day Lady Davers calls their marriage &nbsp;a sham and announces he seduced Sally Godfrey, and had a child with her. They visit a farmhouse where they meet Mr. B&#39;s daughter and learn that her mother now lives married in Jamaica. Pamela proposes taking the girl home with them. The neighbourhood gentry, which once despised Pamela, now praise her.</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c13 c5">&nbsp;</span><span class="c3 c7"><a class="c4" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Fielding&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1736319695550437&amp;usg=AOvVaw1DRXaTX-ASHNqb93ltSxos">Henry Fielding</a></span><span class="c13 c5">&#39;s </span><span class="c3 c7 c2"><a class="c4" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/An_Apology_for_the_Life_of_Mrs._Shamela_Andrews&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1736319695550738&amp;usg=AOvVaw00Vytd2JNEJEyjsHqkekq1">Shamela</a></span><span class="c13 c5">&nbsp;and </span><span class="c3 c7 c2"><a class="c4" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Andrews&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1736319695550906&amp;usg=AOvVaw24c-4xSIcwCrobIp-iBJJv">Joseph Andrews</a></span><span class="c13 c5">&nbsp;and </span><span class="c3 c7"><a class="c4" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eliza_Haywood&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1736319695551084&amp;usg=AOvVaw0q86vqE-qNlS2sDVmVtyiy">Eliza Haywood</a></span><span class="c13 c5">&#39;s </span><span class="c3 c7 c2"><a class="c4" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Anti-Pamela;_or,_Feign%2527d_Innocence_Detected&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1736319695551351&amp;usg=AOvVaw1-gZocwHsT9kleTIG7_yp7">The Anti-Pamela</a></span><span class="c13">&nbsp;were satiric accounts of the novel.</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c16 c2">&nbsp;Pamela in her Exalted Condition</span><span class="c13">&nbsp;(1742) </span><span class="c13">sequel of </span><span class="c13 c2">Pamela, </span><span class="c11">it relates an entanglement where B involved with a widowed countess.

Her family recently got wealthy. &nbsp;His masterpiece, it is considered one of the longest novels in the English language. </span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c11">Robert Lovelace, a libertine is rich courts Clarissa&#39;s sister Arabella Harlowe. She rejects him (and pretends to hate him though she loves him) as he&#39;s interested in her parent&#39;s consent (for wealth). He next targets Clarissa but &nbsp;she insists that she dislikes and distrusts him. Their brother James also dislikes him who he has wounded in a duel and now Arabella grows jealous. Her family wants her to marry one Roger Solmes which she doesn&#39;t want. So her family doubts she might have feelings for Lovelace. She is grounded. She has a friend Anna Howe. She now agrees marrying him. Through Howe she begins secret correspondence with Lovelace as she wants to prevent him from taking revenge on her family. &nbsp;Lovelace pressures Clarissa into agreeing to elope with him as he brags to his friends he will take her virtue as well as to spiting the Harlowes for rejecting him. She agrees to elope but later writes letter informing renegating but Lovelace reads it and places back as if he didn&#39;t get the message. Then Clarissa goes on the appointed time to tell him the message where he gets his servant Joseph Leman, to make noises mimicking a disturbance in the Harlowe household. She feels she&#39;ll be labelled as eloped so goes with Lovelace. She gets to know he wishes to seduce rather than to wed her. He uses seduction and trie to &nbsp;frighten her into submission. She tries to reconcile with her family, but they refuse to listen or forgive. She is held at several lodgings, including unknowingly a brothel, where the women are disguised as high-class ladies. He introduces her to some of his rakehell friends, including John Belford, who becomes a genuine admirer of Clarissa&#39;s purity, beauty and intelligence. In an episode when he pretends saving her from a fire, he gets access to her bedroom. She promises, under threat of rape, to forgive and marry him. Then she escapes, concealing herself in lodgings in Hampstead. He hunts her down to the lodgings where she is hiding and rents all the rooms around her, effectively trapping her. He intercepts a letter to Clarissa from Anna Howe warning her of true extent of his deception and roguery. Then he carries her back to the disguised brothel. First rape: he first drugs and then rapes her. She &nbsp;loses sanity; She writes a series of incoherent &quot;mad letters&quot; (with scattered typography) &nbsp;and verses, blaming herself and him for what has occurred, and begging to be admitted to an asylum to die in peace. He soon realises that he has failed to &quot;subdue&quot; her. Lovelace is forced to concede that, despite the rape, Clarissa&#39;s virtue remains untarnished. &nbsp;Second rape: orchestrates &nbsp;second rape, this time without the aid of stupefying drugs. As he proceeds on a pretext, she threatens to kill herself with a pen-knife should he proceed. He is terrified by her willingness to die for her virtue, Lovelace retreats. Lovelace is called away to attend his dying uncle as he expects inheritance. Leaves her to the prostitutes, Clarissa escapes; the prostitute madam has her arrested; jailed for a few days for unpaid bills. John Belford bails Clarissa from prison. She finds lodgings with a shopkeeper and his wife. She becomes dangerously ill from the stress, rarely eating, convinced that she will die soon. She and Belford become correspondents. In one of the many letters sent to Lovelace, he writes, &quot;if the divine Clarissa asks me to slit thy throat, Lovelace, I shall do it in an instance&quot;. Clarissa reaches out via letter to petition her release from her father&#39;s curse. She dies with Belford as the manager of the will. Lovelace learns that Col. Morden. He arranges an encounter with Col. Morden. Morden is slightly injured in the duel, but Lovelace dies of his injuries the following day. Before dying he says &quot;let this expiate!&quot; Clarissa&#39;s relatives finally realise they have been wrong but it comes too late. They discover Clarissa has already died. The story ends with an account of the fate of the other characters.</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c11">In response to criticism of the novel:</span></p><p class="c23 c7"><span class="c13 c2 c12">A Reply to the Criticism of </span><span class="c2 c3"><a class="c4" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clarissa&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1736319695552911&amp;usg=AOvVaw0__D8mug458dFikllXYvG5">Clarissa</a></span><span class="c13 c15 c12">&nbsp;(1749)</span></p><p class="c23 c7"><span class="c13 c2 c12">Meditations on Clarissa</span><span class="c13 c15 c12">&nbsp;(1751)</span></p><p class="c23 c7"><span class="c13 c2 c12">The Case of Samuel Richardson</span><span class="c13 c12">&nbsp;(1753)</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c16 c2">The History of Sir Charles Grandison</span><span class="c13">&nbsp;(1753</span><span class="c13 c66">&nbsp;7 volumes) making of &ldquo;male Pamela&rdquo;</span><span class="c13">.</span><span class="c13">&nbsp;response to Henry Fielding&#39;s </span><span class="c13 c2">The History of Tom Jones, a Foundling</span><span class="c11">. Had a framing device that he got letters from someone; dropped this framing device from the second edition at Samuel Johnson&#39;s behest. Harriet Byron, orphan living with grandparents, leaving the house of her uncle, George Selby, to visit Mr. and Mrs. Reeves, her cousins, in London. She&#39;s &nbsp;heir to a fortune of fifteen thousand pounds. In London, she is pursued by three suitors: Mr. Greville, Mr. Fenwick, and Mr. Orme. This courtship is followed by more suitors: Mr. Fowler, Sir Rowland Meredith, and Sir Hargrave Pollexfen. Last one is adamant. Pollexfen is rejected by her and he decides to kidnap her. She&#39;s imprisoned at Lisson Grove with the support of a widow and two daughters. &nbsp;Byron attempts to escape from the house, but this fails. So, he transports Byron to his home at Windsor and in transit she&#39;s saved by Charles Grandison. Grandison takes Byron to Colnebrook, the home of Grandison&#39;s brother-in-law, the &quot;Earl of L.&quot;. Grandison wins Pollexfen over and obtains his apology to Byron for his actions. Pol. sends her proposal to marriage which she rejects saying she&#39;s in &nbsp;love with Grandison. However, Granison who once in Italy rescued the Barone della Porretta and a relationship developed between himself and Clementina, the baron&#39;s only daughter. Grandison promised himself to an Italian woman, Signorina Clementina della Porretta. A new suitor, the Earl of D. But the Italian family wanted Grandison to become a Catholic only then he can marry. So he left Italy upon which she grew ill out of despair, and they ask him to return and they will convert to Anglicanism. As he returns, Clementina determines she can never marry a &quot;heretic&quot;, and so Grandison returns to England and Harriet who accepts him. Clementina has fled Italy as she&#39;s forced to marry someone; Sir Charles finds her and shelters her while her family arrives in England to reconcile with her. While she is staying in England, Clementina becomes good friends with Harriet. It is suggested that Harriet is pregnant. The novel ends with the death of Sir Hargrave Pollenfax, who dies miserably of wounds he suffered while behaving with iniquity toward another woman. He laments his behaviour towards Harriet and gives her his estate. In a &quot;Concluding Note&quot; to Grandison added in 1754, Richardson writes: &quot;It has been said, in behalf of many modern fictitious pieces,... that they have exhibited Human Nature as it is.... &nbsp;Is not vice crowned with success, triumphant, and rewarded, and perhaps set off with wit and spirit, a dangerous representation?&quot; Before Fielding died in Lisbon, he included a response to Richardson in his preface to Journal of a Voyage to Lisbon. </span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c11">Defence works:</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c13 c2">2 Letters Concerning Sir Charles Grandison</span><span class="c13">&nbsp;(1754)</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c16 c15 c19">Model Letters:</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c13 c28 c2 c19">Letters Written to and for particular friends,...

Each respectable male meets their female counterpart three times, and each has a parallel incident with letters and an unmasking. The primary plot of the play deals with Wisemore and his pursuit of Lady Matchless.</span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c16 c5 c2">Rape upon Rape; or, The Justice Caught in his own Trap</span><span class="c16 c5">&nbsp;</span><span class="c13 c5">aka </span><span class="c16 c5 c2">The Coffee-House Politician</span><span class="c13 c5">&nbsp;(1730) One of the &#39;she tragedies&rsquo;. Though the play was influenced by the rape case of Colonel Francis Charteris, it used &quot;rape&quot; as an allegory to describe all abuses of freedom, as well as the corruption of power, though it was meant in a comedic, farcical manner. It is known that another act was added to the play, titled </span><span class="c13 c5 c2">The Battle of the Poets</span><span class="c13 c5">, on 30 November 1730, but its author is unknown (?). Adapted into musical titled </span><span class="c13 c5 c2">&nbsp;Lock Up Your Daughters</span><span class="c13 c15 c5">&nbsp;(1959).</span></p><p class="c7 c37"><span class="c13 c5">The play is begun with a prologue that describes the origins of the heroic Muse who uses satire to deal with those who are villains. However, she is not limited to satire, and the heroic Muse is said to provoke individuals towards the destruction of evil in general.</span></p><p class="c37 c7"><span class="c13 c5">After this set up, Fielding introduces a traditional comedic love plot in which Hilaret contemplates running off and marrying Constant. Her father, Politic, stops her from running off with Constant to argue about the role of private and public concerns in regards to love. Their discussion serves as a model for the actions surrounding Justice Squeezum and Justice Worthy, particularly Justice Squeezum&#39;s corruption when it comes to the judicial system, and the play promotes the need for virtue within public and private settings.</span></p><p class="c37 c7"><span class="c13 c15 c5">As the plot progresses, Hilaret is set upon by Ramble, which provokes her to cry out &quot;rape&quot;. During this time, Constant, in an attempt to help a woman, is also accused of rape. They are taken before Justice Squeezum, who reveals his abuses of the judicial system. Hilaret comically forms a plot to catch the corrupt Justice Squeezum; he is able to overcome it because Fielding promotes dealing with corruption only through legal means, which Hilaret fails to do when she resorts to relying on falsified evidence. Although Justice Squeezum and his corrupt nature almost overcomes the other characters, the manner in which this happens is done in a farcical way to provoke laughter.</span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c5 c2">Tom Thumb the Great: A Burlesque Tragedy</span><span class="c5">&nbsp;(1730) ran parallel with </span><span class="c5 c2">Rape.</span><span class="c13 c15 c5">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c5 c2 c20">The Temple Beau</span><span class="c5">&nbsp;(1730) Wilding is a young law student who gives up his studies to seek pleasure.

Fielding cares more about revealing hypocrisy than with a discussion of love and lovers, but he portrays the hypocrites in a manner that emphasises a comedic response instead of censure. Other characters want to have Bellaria, including the virtuous man Veromil and his foil Valentine who is unable to control his desires for Bellaria. Valentine eventually pairs with Clarissa, a character of little substance within the play, Veromil marries Bellaria, and Wilding does not marry.</span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c5 c2 c20">The Author&#39;s Farce and the Pleasures of the Town</span><span class="c5">&nbsp;(1730) Written in response to the </span><span class="c7 c9"><a class="c4" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theatre_Royal,_Drury_Lane&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1736319695562425&amp;usg=AOvVaw3KlWcj04Vh9DR6G7BGpANn">Theatre Royal</a></span><span class="c5">&#39;s rejection of his earlier plays, it was his first stage success. Written in 3 acts: The first and second acts deal with the attempts of the central character, Harry Luckless, Harriot, the daughter of his landlady Mrs. Moneywood, and his efforts to make money by writing plays. When his friend, Witmore, pays his rent behind his back, Luckless steals the money from Mrs. Moneywood. In the second act, he finishes a puppet theatre play titled </span><span class="c5 c2">The Pleasures of the Town</span><span class="c5">, about the Goddess Nonsense&#39;s choice of a husband from allegorical representatives of theatre and other literary genres. It begins when the Goddess of Nonsense chooses a mate from a series of suitors along the </span><span class="c7 c9"><a class="c4" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Styx&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1736319695563003&amp;usg=AOvVaw33cEWrgHDI-DjZgZ7dX0F5">River Styx</a></span><span class="c5">. All dunces, the suitors include Dr. Orator, Sir Farcical Comic, Mrs. Novel, Bookseller, Poet, Monsieur Pantomime, Don Tragedio and Signior Opera. She finally chooses foreign castrato, Signor Opera. &nbsp;Mrs. Novel then claims that she loved Signior Opera, and died giving birth to his child. After its rejection by one theatre, Luckless&#39;s play is staged at another. The third act becomes a play within a play, in which the characters in the puppet play are portrayed by humans. The Author&#39;s Farce ends with a merging of the play&#39;s and the puppet show&#39;s realities. The play within the play is interrupted by Constable and Murdertext, who arrive to arrest Luckless &quot;for abusing Nonsense&quot;, but Mrs. Novel persuades Murdertext to let the play finish.

The play is a low tragedy that describes Tom Thumb, small in size ans status, &nbsp;arriving at King Arthur&#39;s court showing off giants that he defeated. As a reward, Arthur grants Tom the hand of princess Huncamunca, which upsets both his wife, Dollalolla, and a member of the court, Grizzle. The two plot together to ruin the marriage, which begins the tragedy. Part way through the play, two doctors begin to discuss the death of Tom Thumb and resort to using fanciful medical terminology and quoting ancient medical works with which they are not familiar. However, it becomes apparent that it was not Tom who died, but a monkey.</span><span class="c7 c56 c9"><a class="c4" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Thumb_(play)%23cite_note-10&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1736319695566234&amp;usg=AOvVaw1oiYlMINhuJ6GwfjjFV08G">[10]</a></span><span class="c5">&nbsp;The tragedy becomes farcical when Tom is devoured by a cow.

Fielding believed modern tragedies to be superior to the Classic Greek tragedies because the Classics could only invoke pity and fear in the audience, while modern tragedies were able to leave the audience laughing at the ridiculous situations onstage.

The play is same as the eraly one albeit few changes: He completely removed a scene in which two doctors discuss Tom Thumb&#39;s death, and in doing so unified the type of satire that he was working on. Tom is not killed by Grizzle, but instead defeats him. However, Tom is killed by a giant, murderous cow offstage, the news of which prompts a killing spree, leaving seven dead bodies littered on stage and the King alone, left to boast that he is the last to fall, right before stabbing himself.

Although Robin lacks virtue in most regards, such as his stealing from his master, he is able to marry Sweetissa and, at the end of the play, Fielding breaks from his own tradition of comedic marriages by having Owen and Molly marry.</span></p><p class="c23 c7"><span class="c7 c2 c9"><a class="c4" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Modern_Husband&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1736319695571452&amp;usg=AOvVaw1JiAipVMOxBAbWdmErs1eT">The Modern Husband</a></span><span class="c13 c15 c5">&nbsp;(1732)</span></p><p class="c23 c7"><span class="c5 c2">The Lottery </span><span class="c13 c15 c5">(1732)</span></p><p class="c23 c7"><span class="c7 c2 c9"><a class="c4" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Universal_Gallant&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1736319695571962&amp;usg=AOvVaw15X6wV_eUNesNjBbiUzpC4">The Universal Gallant, or The Different Husbands</a></span><span class="c13 c15 c5">&nbsp;(1735)</span></p><p class="c23 c7"><span class="c7 c2 c9 c20"><a class="c4" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pasquin_(play)&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1736319695572321&amp;usg=AOvVaw2GEjLZEfl-tx013xyROzTj">Pasquin</a></span><span class="c5 c20">&nbsp;</span><span class="c5">(1736) It is a satire on both politics and the theatre, with a </span><span class="c7 c9"><a class="c4" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Story_within_a_story&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1736319695572615&amp;usg=AOvVaw1S3fNM39Pq9ldj1KIhtPnd">play within a play</a></span><span class="c5">&nbsp;plot about a group of actors attempting to put on a production about a local election.

He is taken on by Matthew Bramble and family, while they are traveling toward London. Humphry Clinker is a primarily foolish character whose good-natured earnestness earns him the esteem of Matthew Bramble. He is largely described through the letters of Matthew Bramble and Jeremy Melford and, despite his frequent misunderstandings, is presented as a talented worker and gifted orator, attracting a devoted following of parishioners during a brief oratorical stint in London. Humphry suffers false imprisonment due to accusations of being a highway robber, though he retains the confident support of Matthew Bramble and his family. He is rescued and returned to his sweetheart, the maid Winifred Jenkins. Eventually, it is discovered that Humphry is Mr. Bramble&#39;s illegitimate son from a relationship with a barmaid, during his wilder university days.

Secondly, one of his father&#39;s pet theories was that a large and attractive nose was important to a man making his way in life. In a difficult birth, Tristram&#39;s nose was crushed by Dr. Slop&#39;s forceps. Thirdly, another of his father&#39;s theories was that a person&#39;s name exerted enormous influence over that person&#39;s nature and fortunes, with the worst possible name being Tristram. In view of the previous accidents, Tristram&#39;s father decreed that the boy would receive an especially auspicious name,</span><span class="c7"><a class="c4" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermes_Trismegistus&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1736319695615141&amp;usg=AOvVaw3c39lejR3RcobTK3CuTazZ">&nbsp;</a></span><span class="c7 c9"><a class="c4" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermes_Trismegistus&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1736319695615315&amp;usg=AOvVaw0OCaYJjxSUseflp1Ktfb83">Trismegistus</a></span><span class="c7">.

Finally, as a toddler, Tristram suffered an accidental circumcision when Susannah let a window sash fall as he urinated out of the window because his chamberpot was missing.

Uncle Toby&rsquo;s is about fortifications and mock seiges.</span></p><p class="c27"><span class="c7">Dedication to Lord William Pitt</span><span class="c11">.</span></p><p class="c27"><span class="c16 c15 c19">Volume 1</span></p><p class="c27"><span class="c11">The first volume starts with a humorous recount of Tristram Shandy&rsquo;s conception and birth, focusing on his parents, Walter and Elizabeth Shandy. Walter is a scholarly but impractical man with many opinions on child-rearing, while Elizabeth is a passive and often bewildered presence. The narrative dives into a series of digressions, such as Walter&#39;s detailed discussions on trivial matters like the importance of a child&rsquo;s name and the &quot;hobby-horses&quot; (obsessions) of various characters. Uncle Toby, a central figure in the novel and Walter&#39;s brother, is introduced. Toby&rsquo;s obsession with military reenactments, which stems from his experience in the army and his war injury, begins to shape the tone of the story.</span></p><p class="c27"><span class="c16 c15 c19">Volume 2</span></p><p class="c27"><span class="c11">shifts to Tristram&rsquo;s early childhood, offering comic insights into the struggles of the Shandy household. Tristram&rsquo;s birth is retold from several perspectives, emphasizing the mishaps and misunderstandings that complicate it. One of the most significant events is a bungled baptism, during which Tristram is accidentally christened with a name he dislikes. The volume also explores the relationship between Toby and his servant, Corporal Trim, who shares Toby&rsquo;s love of military strategy and adds further humor to the story with his own quirks and mannerisms. Through their interactions, Sterne expands on themes of friendship, loyalty, and eccentricity.</span></p><p class="c27"><span class="c16 c15 c19">Volume 3</span></p><p class="c27"><span class="c11">covers Tristram&rsquo;s early experiences, but it also broadens to describe Uncle Toby&rsquo;s war injury in more detail. Walter Shandy, concerned about his son&#39;s education, is continually frustrated by various setbacks, which Sterne relays with satirical humor. There is a particularly memorable scene in which Tristram, as a child, suffers an injury to his nose&mdash;a result of the clumsy doctor Dr. Slop, who is often at odds with Walter. Tristram&rsquo;s nose becomes a symbol of the father&rsquo;s misplaced anxieties about his son&rsquo;s future. Meanwhile, Uncle Toby&rsquo;s war injury becomes a frequent topic, and his interactions with Dr. Slop and the parson, Mr. Yorick, reflect the novel&rsquo;s digressive style.</span></p><p class="c27"><span class="c16 c15 c19">Volume 4</span></p><p class="c27"><span class="c11">Here, Sterne focuses on Tristram&rsquo;s botched circumcision, which occurs accidentally due to a window sash falling on him. This unfortunate event, told in a humorous manner, reflects the novel&rsquo;s emphasis on the ridiculousness of misfortune. The volume also delves into Uncle Toby&#39;s romantic interest in Widow Wadman, who appears as a character to lighten Toby&rsquo;s mood and create tension in his life. Through these incidents, Sterne parodies traditional storytelling by interrupting the main narrative with elaborate asides, such as Walter&#39;s rants on scientific theories and philosophical digressions on human nature.</span></p><p class="c27"><span class="c16 c15 c19">Volume 5</span></p><p class="c27"><span class="c11">includes more satirical commentary on various subjects, notably time and memory, which Sterne explores through Tristram&rsquo;s attempts to tell his story in a chronological fashion. This volume reflects Sterne&rsquo;s philosophical musings on the impossibility of narrating life in a linear way. Uncle Toby&rsquo;s courtship of Widow Wadman is further developed, providing comic relief and shedding light on Toby&rsquo;s naivety. Sterne uses the character&rsquo;s innocent misunderstandings to reveal Toby&#39;s sensitivity and humanity, contrasting it with Walter&rsquo;s intellectualized detachment.</span></p><p class="c27"><span class="c16 c15 c19">Volume 6</span></p><p class="c27"><span class="c11">Tristram, now grown, decides to travel across Europe, adding an episodic element to the novel. He shares details of his journey, blending travelogue with introspection. This section reflects Tristram&#39;s desire to escape the disappointments of his youth and explore new perspectives. Along the way, he meets various characters, who add to the novel&rsquo;s diversity of eccentric personalities. Sterne uses these travel experiences to comment on the absurdities of social conventions, poking fun at cultural differences and the often futile nature of travel as a means of self-discovery.</span></p><p class="c27"><span class="c16 c15 c19">Volume 7</span></p><p class="c27"><span class="c11">Tristram&rsquo;s European adventures continue, but they are secondary to his commentary on mortality and human suffering. Sterne offers poignant reflections on the fleeting nature of life, which contrast with the earlier, lighthearted volumes. In a memorable scene, Tristram suffers a severe illness in France, which leads him to confront the fragility of human existence. The volume maintains the digressive structure, filled with philosophical asides and humorous observations that underscore Sterne&rsquo;s belief in the importance of enjoying life despite its many uncertainties.</span></p><p class="c27"><span class="c16 c15 c19">Volume 8</span></p><p class="c27"><span class="c11">Returning to England, Tristram reflects on the Shandy family estate and the peculiarities of his upbringing. He comments on Uncle Toby&rsquo;s continued relationship with Widow Wadman, which has evolved into a delicate courtship. This volume is marked by a return to the eccentricities of the Shandy household, with Walter&rsquo;s latest schemes and plans occupying much of the narrative. Sterne also elaborates on Toby&rsquo;s obsession with military reenactments, offering a poignant reflection on how people use hobbies to cope with past traumas and disappointments.</span></p><p class="c27"><span class="c16 c15 c19">Volume 9</span></p><p class="c27"><span class="c11">The final volume brings together the major themes of the novel, including time, memory, and identity. Uncle Toby&rsquo;s relationship with Widow Wadman comes to a head, with a comical twist as she inquires about the specifics of his war injury, hinting at her ulterior motives. Sterne closes the novel with a return to Tristram&rsquo;s reflections on the act of writing itself, emphasizing the limitations of language and narrative. The novel ends abruptly, fitting the style of Sterne&rsquo;s storytelling, leaving readers with a sense of life&rsquo;s unpredictability and the elusive nature of meaning.</span></p><p class="c27"><span>The curvy line from Volume IX, Chapter IV of </span><span class="c2">Tristram Shandy</span><span>&nbsp;is reprinted at the start of</span><span><a class="c4" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Honor%25C3%25A9_de_Balzac&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1736319695618560&amp;usg=AOvVaw1C8NXnt7TEEZqdvc6ME_Eo">&nbsp;</a></span><span class="c0"><a class="c4" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Honor%25C3%25A9_de_Balzac&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1736319695618768&amp;usg=AOvVaw2HBZU3DsMGEf_yMpg321gu">Balzac</a></span><span>&#39;s novel</span><span><a class="c4" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/La_Peau_de_chagrin&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1736319695618909&amp;usg=AOvVaw3zxmcoAXx3bEMT_uDvIW_R">&nbsp;</a></span><span class="c0 c2"><a class="c4" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/La_Peau_de_chagrin&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1736319695619032&amp;usg=AOvVaw2t2Lx_kGDlPhSqoViMQ1cR">La Peau de chagrin</a></span><span>. </span><span class="c11 c7">A curvy line drawn in the air by a character seeking to express the freedom enjoyed &quot;whilst a man is free&quot;.</span></p><p class="c27"><span class="c7">Ferriar believed that Sterne was ridiculing Burton&#39;s </span><span class="c7 c2">The Anatomy of Melancholy</span><span class="c7">, mocking its solemn tone and endeavours to prove indisputable facts by weighty quotations.

Then, from a vantage-point in the Alps, he surveys the condition of the world. Every nation, he says, considers itself the happiest, but this is only because each nation judges by its own standards. In fact, happiness is probably equally spread, though in different forms which tend to be mutually exclusive. Goldsmith turns to consider various countries individually: Italy is naturally fertile and was formerly successful in commerce, but has since been overtaken by other countries; The Swiss have poverty, but also equality but have no nobility of soul; France is a nation motivated by honour, and is therefore too prone to vanity; Holland&rsquo;s industry has brought prosperity but &nbsp;liberty itself is barter&#39;d here; Britain&#39;s free constitution has led to a lack of social cohesion, the rich defending their own liberties by oppressing the poor. Those who have escaped this problem by fleeing across the Atlantic have found a harsh and dangerous land in America.

Goldsmith wrote this 160-line romantic ballad in 1765. The hero and heroine are Edwin, a youth without wealth or power, and Angelina, the daughter of a lord &quot;beside the Tyne&quot;. Angelina spurns many wooers, but refuses to make plain her love for young Edwin. &quot;Quite dejected with my scorn&quot;, Edwin disappears and becomes a hermit. One day, Angelina turns up at his cell in boy&#39;s clothes and, not recognising him, tells him her story. Edwin then reveals his true identity, and the lovers never part again. The poem is notable for its interesting portrayal of a hermit, who is fond of the natural world and his wilderness solitude but maintains a gentle, sympathetic demeanour toward other people. In keeping with eremitical tradition, however, Edwin the Hermit claims to &quot;spurn the [opposite] sex&quot;.

In the poem, Goldsmith criticises rural depopulation, the moral corruption found in towns, consumerism, enclosure, landscape gardening, avarice, and the pursuit of wealth from international trade. The poem employs, in the words of one critic, &quot;deliberately precise obscurity&quot;, and does not reveal the reason why the village has been deserted. Its ominous &quot;Ill fares the land&quot; warning is famous. The location of the village remains unknown although some argue for Auburn village close to Athlone to be the subject. Others have seen it as Nuneham Courtenay described in &nbsp;&quot;The Revolution in Low Life&quot; in which he also depicts how an old woman returns to live her life in the village.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c7">Poem opens with Auburn&rsquo;s descirtion: &ldquo;</span><span>Sweet Auburn! loveliest village of the plain; / Where health and plenty cheered the labouring swain&rdquo;.

In sentimental comedy, Goldsmith continued, the virtues of private life were exhibited, rather than the vices exposed; and the distresses rather than the faults of humankind generated interest in the piece. Characters in these plays were almost always good; if they had faults, the spectator was expected not only to pardon but to applaud them, in consideration of the goodness of their hearts. Thus, according to Goldsmith, folly was commended instead of being ridiculed.

The novel itself begins with these two latter figures hunting, whereas the manuscript is missing the first ten chapters and approximately thirty others at various locations throughout the manuscript&#39;s entirety. As a young boy, Harley loses his parents and is assigned several guardians who constantly disagree with each other. They ask him to make an old distant relative amiable towards him for inheritance. &nbsp;Upon failing, Harley is then advised to acquire a patron; to sell his vote at an election for a lease of land. His neighbour Mr. Walton gives him a letter of introduction, and he leaves home (and Miss Walton) for London. In the following (missing) chapters, Harley formally visits the baronet Mr. Walton recommended him to, because when the narrative continues, Harley is calling on him for the second time.

At its conclusion her father arrives, and after a misunderstanding is reconciled with his daughter. After getting to know that his claim for the land lease has failed, Harley takes a stage-coach back home. Harley continues on foot, and along the way meets Edwards, an old farmer from his village who has fallen on hard times and is returning from his conscription in the army. Together they approach the village, to find the school house destroyed, and two orphans who are actually the grandchildren of Harley&#39;s companion. Harley takes the three of them home, and provides some land for them. After discussing corrupt military commanders with Edwards, Harley is informed to his dismay that Miss Walton is going to be married to Sir Harry Benson. </span><span class="c2">The Man of Feeling</span><span>&nbsp;then jumps to an unconnected tale of a man named Mountford, who journeys to Milan as tutor to the young Sedley, where they meet with a count. They visit a debtors&#39; prison to find a man and his family living there at the behest of the count&#39;s son, a man who had been so charming to the two gentlemen. Sedley pays the family&#39;s debt, and then Mountford and Sedley leave Milan in disgust. Jamie is then renowned as the &#39;Man of Feeling&#39; and is distressed to find that his entry is no longer there. The narrative returns to the story of Harley. Miss Walton has not married Benson. She visits an unwell Harley (who has contracted a fever nursing Edwards and his grandchildren), who confesses his love to her.

His widowed Matilda &quot;forbore to sacrifice the lives of her few remaining people to a feeble attempt at retaliation&quot;. She withdrew from public life to raise her children in the &quot;bosom of her people and family&quot;. Earl&#39;s children, Osbert and Mary, now nineteen and seventeen respectively. &nbsp;They are refined. Osbert learns of his father&#39;s death wishes to lead his clansmen against Dunbayne to avenge him but is forbidden by his mother. Osbert departs to wander the Highlands, where he meets by chance a young Highland peasant named Alleyn after losing his way and becomes Osbert&#39;s guide through the countryside. He learns of people&#39;s displeasure with the Baron. Alleyn is invited to Athlin as Osbert&#39;s guest. Osbert agrees to lead an effort against the castle of Dunbayne. They invade but are unsuccessful and Alleyn and Osbert are taken captive as prisoners of war. Matilda offers ransom to the Baron who rejects and in turn asks for the capture of beautiful Mary to be used as a negotiation tool. She is saved by Alleyn and they fall for each other though he is mere peasant. Osbert in his prison finds two ladies who appear to also be prisoners of Malcolm within the castle. They turn out to be Louisa, the widow of the former Baron of Dunbayne and Malcolm&#39;s sister-in-law, and her beautiful daughter Laura (whose music Osbert has heard): Malcom had imprisoned the Baroness and her daughter within the castle. He escapes and later kills Malcom in a battle. Before his death, he reveals that Alleyn is in fact Philip, Louisa&#39;s long-lost son who is recognized by a strawberry mark on his skin. This makes Alleyn the rightful Baron of Dunbayne. The novel ends with the double wedding of Laura and Osbert, and Mary and Alleyn.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5 c2 c20">A Sicilian Romance</span><span class="c5">&nbsp;(1790</span><span>) &nbsp;</span><span class="c7 c9"><a class="c4" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walter_Scott&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1736319695666199&amp;usg=AOvVaw1CK1N2HrMsOHd5hY1ieUiW">Walter Scott</a></span><span class="c5">&nbsp;recalled: &quot;we ourselves well recollect, attracted in no ordinary degree the attention of the public.&quot; Recounts tale of fallen nobility of the house of Mazzini, on the northern shore of </span><span class="c7 c9"><a class="c4" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sicily&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1736319695666528&amp;usg=AOvVaw3Fa1ak78xDlRps5QE7th4C">Sicily</a></span><span class="c5">, as related by a tourist who learns of their turbulent history from a monk he meets at the ruins of their once-magnificent castle.

They are led waylaid by darkness and Peter is sent to find some help. He reaches a house and is welcome. He is given a bed and promptly locked in the room. Sometime later, the door to Pierre&#39;s room is unlocked and a beautiful young lady, Adeline, is being dragged behind the stranger who admitted Pierre to the house. He is forced to take her with him and never return which he does. They are conveyed to the carriage by the ruffian stranger with Madame still inside. As they proceed, they &nbsp;find refuge in a ruined abbey after their wagon wheel breaks. They find the only inhabitants are mice, owls, bats etc. Peter is sent into the town of Auboine for supplies to fix their broken wagon wheel. He gets into a fight and could only procure food so they settle into the abbey making it inhabitable. After some time passes, while in town, Peter comes across a gentleman who inquires about the La Motte family. the servants all go into hiding through the trap door Pierre has found in one of the bedrooms thinking they were the creditors. Pierre discovers a skeleton in a chest. Soon they see someone approach and it turn out to be Pierre and Madame&#39;s son, Louis. Madame thinks Adeline seeks to have an affair with her husband and stays hostile to her while asking Louis to find out. &nbsp;Louis has fallen in love with Adeline and pines for her saying &ldquo;I should esteem myself most happy, if I could be of service to you.&rdquo; Later they hear &nbsp;a trampling of horses near the abbey and it turns out to be Marquis de Montalt, who is the owner of the abbey, and his attendants, one of which is named Theodore. Theodore attempts to warn Adeline that he fears she has been deceived and danger is upon her. She thinks it&rsquo;s her father coming back for her. Adeline also finds a manuscript written by someone who had been held captive inside the abbey during 1642. Adeline ultimately informs Pierre of the manuscript once she reaches particularly terrifying point while reading it. The Marquis wants to make Adeline his wife and was discussing the matter with Pierre although she knows she will be a mistress as he has a wife. She attempts to escape with Peter&rsquo;s help. Adeline is tricked, and instead she is taken to the Marquis&rsquo; residence. She tries to escape the Marquis by climbing out the window where she runs into Theodore who rescues her and takes her to an inn where Marquis finds them. Theodore wounds him in a fight and is now charges for attacking a senior officer. &nbsp;Adeline realises she is in love with Theodore while he is sick. Pierre realises he is powerless and his morals are compromised as he is in the power of Marquis as he suggests he now wants to kill her. Pierre finds he is unable to allow Adeline to be killed, thus he sends Adeline with Peter on horseback to Peter&rsquo;s sister&rsquo;s house in Leloncourt. She&rsquo;s nursed to health first by Peter&rsquo;s sister and later by Clara la Luc. Clara&rsquo;s father Arnaud la Luc adopts her and later he is sick of consumption and has to move to Paris for health. Adeline finds out Theodore is imprisoned, and his death is imminent because of the assault he made on his general officer. It is revealed that Theodore is the son of Lencourt. He is in Paris awaiting his execution. Here, &nbsp;Pierre de la Motte is placed on trial for a robbery he previously committed against the Marquis before he knew who the Marquis was. The Marquis would not have pressed any charges had Pierre assisted the murder of Adeline. Presently, however, Monsieur and Madame de la Motte are in Paris. Pierre is imprisoned and Madame is with him. it is discovered that the Marquis is not who he claims to be; he had previously murdered Adeline&#39;s father and stolen his inheritance. In the last hours of his life, while tortured with the remembrance of his crime, he resolved to make all the atonement that remained for him, and having swallowed the potion, he immediately sent for a confessor to take a full confession of his guilt, and two notaries, and thus established Adeline beyond dispute in the rights of her birth, also bequeathing her a considerable legacy&quot;.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5">Radcliff was influenced by books like Walpole&rsquo;s gothic fiction.</span><span class="c5"><a class="c4" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clara_Reeve&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1736319695670069&amp;usg=AOvVaw0g_aCe71eR3mAf_4k-0P5W">&nbsp;</a></span><span class="c7 c9"><a class="c4" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clara_Reeve&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1736319695670415&amp;usg=AOvVaw3ffNt0WWS9_PxrJhpa0IUz">Clara Reeve</a></span><span class="c5">&nbsp;wrote </span><span class="c7 c2 c9"><a class="c4" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Old_English_Baron&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1736319695670735&amp;usg=AOvVaw2MSWKMuZZMui-_TY7OIj4F">The Old English Baron</a></span><span class="c5">, the first &quot;Gothic&quot; novel to be penned by a woman, and in 1783 </span><span class="c7 c9"><a class="c4" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sophia_Lee&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1736319695671026&amp;usg=AOvVaw1p2Kz0_OEg4pb-U4TeFPnR">Sophia Lee</a></span><span class="c5">&nbsp;produced </span><span class="c5 c2">The Recess</span><span class="c13 c15 c5">, a story set in the time of Queen Elizabeth I.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5 c2 c20">The Mysteries of Udolpho </span><span class="c5">(1794, 4 vols.) her most popular novel, it is often cited as an </span><span class="c7 c9"><a class="c4" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archetype&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1736319695671637&amp;usg=AOvVaw0ajMuSsz_z0FlZflAdeh2M">archetypal</a></span><span class="c5">&nbsp;example of the Gothic novel.

He is promised he will be sent his narrative confession. &nbsp;The Englishman reads the story in his hotel room as follows:</span><span class="c11">&nbsp;In 1758 in the church of San Lorenzo in Naples where Vincentio di Vivaldi sees the beautiful Ellena di Rosalba with her aunt, Signora Bianchi and falls for her. When Vivaldi&#39;s mother, the proud Marchesa, hears about his love for a poor orphan, she appeals to her ambitious and cunning confessor, Father Schedoni, to prevent the marriage, with a promise that she will help him obtain promotion in his order. A monk, who seems to be an apparition, threatening him to keep away from the villa and Ellena. Vivaldi tries in vain to capture the strange monk, with the help of his friend Bonarmo and his faithful servant Paulo. Vivaldi suspects that the monk is Father Schedoni, and is determined to know why his courtship of Ellena is discouraged. He find Ellena held at the remote convent of San Stefano, at the mercy of a cruel Lady Abbess. &nbsp;In the convent, Ellena befriends a lovely but melancholy nun, Sister Olivia, who helps her escape from the convent into the care of Vivaldi. As he meets her and escape, he persuades her to marry him there and then. Before taking vows, agents claiming to work for the Inquisition, informed by Schedoni, interrupt and arrest Vivaldi on the false charge of abducting a nun from a convent. She is sent by order of Schedoni to a lone house on the seashore, inhabited only by the villain Spalatro, to be murdered. Later Schedoni seeing a portrait on her person believes she is his daughter. Spalatro is dismissed yet he follows them to extort money. Spalatro is shot in a scuffle and left behind. Schedoni places Ellena in the convent of Santa Maria del Pianto until Vivaldi can be freed. He distracts the Marchesa temporarily with information that Ellena comes from a noble lineage, so a marriage would at least be proper, if not lucrative. Meanwhile, in the prison of the Inquisition, the mysterious monk who had previously eluded Vivaldi, now known to be Nicola di Zampari, appears and narrates to him the guilty crimes of Father Schedoni before he became a monk, and convinces him to formally call Schedoni and Father Ansaldo, to whom Schedoni had previously disclosed his deeds in a confessional booth, to the trial as the accused and witness, respectively, in the crimes. Schedoni is convicted from their testimony of murdering his brother, as well as marrying and later stabbing his brother&#39;s wife in a jealous rage, in his former life as the dissolute Count di Bruno, or Count di Marinella. Schedoni is sentenced to death, and before he is led away into confinement, tells Vivaldi his relationship to Ellena and her whereabouts. Schedoni, on his deathbed, in the presence of the tribunal, further reveals that he had already fatally poisoned both himself and his betrayer Nicola with poison concealed in his vest. Beatrice and Olivia recognise each other, and elate Ellena with the news that she is the daughter of Olivia, who is revealed to be the Countess di Bruno, whom Schedoni had stabbed in jealous rage and left for dead. &nbsp;This leads Ellena to realise that she is actually not Schedoni&#39;s daughter, but his niece. Once it is revealed that Ellena is from an aristocratic family, it is determined that she has the royal blood that allows her to be worthy of marrying Vivaldi. Vivaldi and Paulo are released from prison, Ellena is reunited with her mother, and Vivaldi and Ellena are joined in marriage, and all the villains have died. The Marchesa dies shortly before finding out that her son has been freed from prison. Father Schedoni, condemned to die, poisons himself and Nicola di Zampari, and calls a tribunal including the Marchese and Vivaldi to witness their final confessions at his deathbed.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5 c2 c20">Gaston de Blondeville</span><span class="c5">&nbsp;(1826, posthumously) Set in the 13th-century court of </span><span class="c7 c9"><a class="c4" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_English_monarchs&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1736319695676336&amp;usg=AOvVaw0dRPRGTbyDNFoZFNGUf_wG">England&#39;s King</a></span><span class="c5">&nbsp;</span><span class="c7 c9"><a class="c4" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_III_of_England&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1736319695676505&amp;usg=AOvVaw1Pvcxtr1W0wNB9g8FLEouX">Henry III</a></span><span class="c5">, the novel centres around the wedding of the title character.

She begs him to make love to her, and he agrees reluctantly. Later, she performs a ritual in the cemetery and she lives. They have sexual relation but he grows tired of her. He meets Antonia and is immediately attracted to her. He starts visiting Antonia&#39;s mother regularly to trap her. Lorenzo has secured his family&#39;s blessing for his marriage with Antonia. &nbsp;Matilda tells him she can help him to gain Antonia&#39;s charms with the help of Lucifer who gives them a magic myrtle bough, which will allow Ambrosio to open any door, as well as rape Antonia without her knowing.

They are going to a trip to London and she asks for permission to go with them. She goes; makes &nbsp;</span><span class="c5 c2">faux pas</span><span class="c13 c15 c5">&nbsp;and finds social embarrassment over her manners. She catches attention of two guys: Lord Orville, a handsome and extremely eligible peer and pattern-card of modest, becoming behaviour; and Sir Clement Willoughby, a baronet with duplicitous intentions. This ends in an &nbsp;untimely reunion in London with her grandmother and the Branghtons, her long-unknown extended family, which makes her believe she&rsquo;s not made for Orville. They return along with Duval and Evelina. Mme Duval concocts a plan to sue Sir John Belmont, Evelina&#39;s father, and force him to recognize his daughter&#39;s claim to his estate in court. &nbsp;He does not believe it possible for Evelina to be his daughter, as he already has a young lady who is his supposed daughter (who, unbeknownst to him is actually illegitimate), and therefore assumes Mme Duval to be trying to dupe him for his money. Evelina return to London with her grandmother, where she is forced to spend time with her ill-bred Branghton cousins and their rowdy friends, but she is distracted by Mr. Macartney, a melancholy and direly-poor Scottish poet whom she sees with 2 gus and she deduces that he&rsquo;s going for suicide but he informs her that they are for highway robbery because he&rsquo;s in distress owing to being engaged in tracing his own obscure parentage, as well as recovering from his mother&#39;s sudden death and the discovery that his beloved is actually his sister. &nbsp;She assists him financially. There she faces some strange accidents: during her visit to the Marylebone pleasure garden, for instance, she is attacked by a drunken sailor and accosted by several rowdy men before being rescued by prostitutes&mdash;and in this humiliating company, she meets Lord Orville again. But she finds him looking out for her. When an insulting and brash letter supposedly from Lord Orville devastates her and makes her believe she misperceived him, she returns home to Berry Hill and falls ill. &nbsp;Evelina agrees to accompany her neighbour, a sarcastically tempered widow named Mrs. Selwyn, to the resort town of Clifton Heights, where she unwillingly attracts the attention of womanizer Lord Merton, on the eve of his marriage to Lord Orville&#39;s sister, Lady Louisa Larpent. She anticipates &nbsp;Lord Orville&#39;s arrival and is torn between attraction to him and belief in his past duplicity. Mr. Macartney comes and Orville doubts he&rsquo;s a thing for her but she informs he&rsquo;s there to repay his financial debt to Evelina. Selwyn hears &nbsp;Lord Orville arguing with Sir Clement Willoughby about his wrong intentions for Evelina. Lord Orville proposes; she accepts. Mrs. Selwyn is able to secure a surprise meeting with Sir John who instantly and shamefully recognizes her as his daughter. This means that the other Miss Belmont (the false daughter) is recognized as a fraud. She delivery of a letter written by her mother on her deathbed in which she forgives Sir John for his behaviour if he will remove her ignominy by accepting his daughter. Mrs Clifton identifies Polly Green, Evelina&#39;s former wet nurse, mother of a girl 6 weeks older than Evelina, as the perpetrator of the fraud. Polly has been passing her own daughter off as that of Sir John and Caroline for the past 18 years, hoping to secure a better future for her. Ultimately, Lord Orville suggests that the unfortunate girl be named co-heiress with Evelina; kindhearted Evelina is delighted. Finally, Sir Clement Willoughby writes to Evelina, confessing that he had written the insulting letter (she had already suspected this), hoping to separate Evelina and Lord Orville. &nbsp;In Paris, Mr. Macartney is reunited with the false Miss Belmont, his former beloved: separated by Sir John, at first because Macartney was too poor and lowly to marry his purported daughter, and then because his affair with Macartney&#39;s mother would have made the sweethearts brother and sister, they are now able to marry because Miss &quot;Belmont&quot;&#39;s true parentage has been revealed and the two are not related at all. They are married in a joint ceremony alongside Evelina and Lord Orville, who decide to visit Reverend Villars at Berry Hill for their honeymoon trip.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5 c2 c32 c20">Cecilia: Memoirs of an Heiress</span><span class="c5 c14">&nbsp;(1782) &nbsp;Cecilia Beverley, 20-year-old </span><span class="c0 c14 c7"><a class="c4" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/heroine&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1736319695694257&amp;usg=AOvVaw38l_TFxTOQytnv7nee9Uj5">heroine</a></span><span>, </span><span class="c5 c14">is an </span><span class="c0 c14 c7"><a class="c4" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/orphan&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1736319695694519&amp;usg=AOvVaw08bYqJcVTwyIwvCGx6yE2X">orphan</a></span><span class="c5 c14">&nbsp;</span><span class="c0 c14 c7"><a class="c4" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/heiress&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1736319695694699&amp;usg=AOvVaw3FEqiMz7zlgHkUykJntkU8">heiress</a></span><span class="c5 c14">&nbsp;(&pound;3000 a year as soon as she becomes of age, with a smaller personal </span><span class="c0 c14 c7"><a class="c4" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/fortune&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1736319695694887&amp;usg=AOvVaw2AD7lkPCttlAj854YdEcfi">fortune</a></span><span class="c5 c14">&nbsp;of &pound;10,000).

Later, she meets Mrs. Delvile, and is delighted to see that she is a kind, witty, and refreshingly elegant lady, and begins to think of staying with them, instead of with the Harrels. As she meets Albany again, a little girl named Henrietta, sister of Belfield, tells her he was badly wounded and she helps her with money.

She goes to Mr Delvile to help her discouraging Sir Robert Floyer&#39;s unwanted attentions. There she is surprised by his sudden coldness towards her. Mr. Harrel continues to rack up unpaid gambling debts. He suddenly takes them all to Vauxhall, where, after drinking, he kisses his wife and then commits suicide shortly thereafter by shooting himself. They travel to Delvile Castle, where Cecilia finds Mortimer&#39;s behaviour yet more confusing, and Mrs. Delvile makes clear to her that she does not want Cecilia to marry her son. He confesses he cannot marry her because he would have to change his name from Delvile to Beverley and thus he decides to leave the country. She says goodbye to him coolly. Later, she visits old family friend, Mrs. Charlton where she meets Mr. Biddulph, friend of Mortimer who sees she has feelings for Mortimer. &nbsp;Lady Honoria plays a trick by stealing Mortimer&#39;s dog, Fidel, giving it to Cecilia to tease her. One day, Cecilia, patting the dog, talks to him about her love for Mortimer, and how much she misses him. Meanwhile, Mortimer overhears this entire conversation. He comes back and &nbsp; asks her to marry him. She refuses. He suggests they elope. She tells her plans to Mr Monckton who foils it. Mrs. Delvile, hearing of it, comes and makes clear to Cecilia that she will never let them marry. She finally agrees that she will not meet Mortimer. &nbsp;Mrs. Delvile, horrified, suddenly falls so ill that both Mortimer and Cecilia are frightened and they part for good. &nbsp;Mr. Albany comes, however, and says that his sadness is greater, and tells his history&mdash;how he loved a woman, but she became a prostitute, and after a fight, she died and this made him crazy for three years. Mrs. Charlton suddenly dies and since Cecilia is come of age, she buys her own house and takes Henrietta in. Mortimer&#39;s sudden visit there shocks her as he proposes his mother is ready to accept their marriage if she gives up her fprtune and only marry using her personal fortune. She says she has used it all up. Later, &nbsp;Mrs. Delvile agrees to the marriage, but Mr. Delvile says so many bad things about Cecilia that they argue, and separate. Cecilia and Mortimer marry quietly and happily. Two days later, Mrs. Matt, one of the poor people she has helped, tells her who stopped her first wedding&mdash;Miss Bennet! Cecilia quickly figures out that the person who sent her must have been Mr. Monckton. She also realizes that he, too, must have been the one who lied so bitterly about her to Mr. Delvile. Shortly after, a servant comes and tells her that Mr. Monckton is dead. However, as Mortimer comes, he tells her he knows Monckton was behind it and therefore they shot each other in which he was injured. She tells hi to leave England which he does. However, her marriage has been heard of, and her fortune is suddenly taken away from her while Mortimer is gone. She &nbsp;goes to Mr. Belfield to ask for help; but when she goes there, Mortimer suddenly walks into the room and sees them together. He grow jealous and leaves her. Angry, surprised, and jealous, he leaves. Cecilia begins to grow crazy. She tries to go to Mr. Delvile for help, but he proudly refuses to see her. At last, some people, thinking she has escaped from an insane asylum, lock her up in a room and write in a newspaper about her.

In the end, they live happily together, and later, Mrs. Delvile&#39;s sister gives Cecilia a lot of money when she dies, so Cecilia can begin helping the poor again with Albany, who is very happy that she did not die.

Augustus (&quot;Mr Tyrold&quot;) and Sir Hugh Tyrold &nbsp;reunited after Sir Hugh sends Mr Tyrold a letter expressing his desire to move near his parsonage, as he is physically less active and injured now and wants solitude. Thus Mr Tyrold is requested to purchase an estate called Cleves and prepare it for the arrival of Sir Hugh, his niece Indiana Lynmere, and her governess Miss Margland (his other ward, Clermont Lynmere, is to be sent to &quot;the Continent&quot; to be educated). He &nbsp;persuades Mr Tyrold to engage a tutor. Mr Tyrold complies and hires Dr Orkborne, a man better suited to private academic pursuits than pedagogy. Sir Hugh becomes enchanted by his brother&#39;s middle daughter, Camilla, and decides to make her heiress to most of his fortune. Gets to raise her. It is there that Camilla&#39;s brother Lionel, elder sister, Lavinia, and younger sister, Eugenia, and her father&#39;s ward, Edgar Mandelbert, go to celebrate Camilla&#39;s tenth birthday. They are not allowed outside as Euginia has not been inoculated but since they trick Hugh into giing permission to visit fare, she gets smallpox which disfigures her. She later is maimed by a see-saw accident. So Hugh disowns ever nicece and nephew except her as he justifies this by arranging an eventual marriage between Eugenia and Clermont Lynmere. He consigns Eugenia&#39;s education to Dr Orkbourne so that she may engage her future husband in what he calls </span><span class="c5 c14 c2">hic h&aelig;c hoc</span><span class="c15 c5 c14 c38">&mdash;that is, is to receive the same sort of intensive, classical education that was at the time more generally given to boys and rarely to girls. Reluctant to teach a girl at first, Dr Orkbourne discovers that Eugenia is not only an enthusiastic student but one who is also extremely intelligent and capable. &nbsp;Edgar Mandelbert finds himself drawn to Indiana&#39;s exquisite beauty. Hugh starts planning about their marriage. When Edgar does finish his education and reaches the age of majority, &nbsp;Edgar finds himself drawn to Camilla and she to him. Unfortunately, the mortifying realization that he is considered to be Indiana&#39;s intended complicates his attempts at courtship until he can resolve the misunderstanding. Even so, the machinations of Miss Margland, the jealousy of Indiana, circumstances in general (including Camilla&#39;s misadventures in navigating country society and new acquaintances such as the dim-witted Mr Dubster, the rakish Sir Sedley Clarendel, and the beautiful, reputable, witty, but lamentably satirical widow Mrs Arlbery) and Edgar&#39;s judgmental nature in particular serve to make his wooing of Camilla extremely protracted. He finally wins Camilla&#39;s hand only to relinquish it almost immediately after catching Sir Sedley Clarendel kissing Camilla&#39;s hand. She removes to Southampton to visit her new friend, Mrs Berlington, with Eugenia, Indiana, and Miss Margland which he takes as a sign that Camilla is capricious, weak, frivolous, and above all a debased flirt. While Camilla suffers through one misadventure after the other, her sister Eugenia attracts the notice of fortune hunter Alphonso Bellamy who asks Sir Hugh for Eugenia&#39;s hand. He is refused, not being known to Sir Hugh nor particularly welcome as Eugenia is intended for Clermont. Bellamy eventually kidnaps Eugenia and forces her into marriage; Edgar eventually stops listening to the misogynistic Dr Marchmont; Camilla falls into and gets out of debt; Lionel is forced to give up frivolity; Sir Hugh is nearly bankrupted by his nephews; and Mr Tyrold spends some time in debtors&#39; prison. But all ends well as Bellamy accidentally kills himself, Mr Tyrold is freed, Camilla and Edgar are married, Lavinia marries Hal Westwyn, Indiana elopes with a penniless hotheaded military ensign called Macdersey, Clermont gets beaten by a servant he unfairly tried to whip, and Eugenia (it is hinted) eventually marries Mr Melmond, a man whose fine education and extremely emotional outbursts had won her heart early in the novel.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5 c2 c32 c20">The Wanderer; or, Female Difficulties </span><span class="c5 c14">(1814) historical novel with </span><span class="c0 c14 c7"><a class="c4" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gothic_fiction&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1736319695700642&amp;usg=AOvVaw1trpsH8S9L840dnG5AQ-8k">Gothic</a></span><span class="c5 c14">&nbsp;overtones set during the 1790s.

The story is about a young girl, Rosamond, who needs new pair of shoes but is attracted to a purple jar which she sees displayed in a shop window. When her mother gives her the choice of spending her money on shoes or the jar, she chooses the purple jar. &quot;You might be disappointed&quot;, her mother cautions, adding that Rosamond will not be able to buy new shoes until the next month. When the girl gets home, she discovers that the jar was not purple but clear and filled with a dark liquid. She cries: &quot;I didn&#39;t want this black stuff!&quot; Adding to her disappointment, her father refuses to take her out in public because she looks slovenly without good shoes.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5 c2 c20">Castle Rackrent</span><span class="c5">&nbsp;(1800) the first historical novel, the first regional novel in English, the first Anglo-Irish novel, the first Big House novel, and the first saga novel. It is widely regarded as the first Irish novel to use the device of a narrator who is both unreliable and an observer of, rather than a player in, the actions he chronicles. It also has a glossary (which was a last-minute addition). Unlike many of her other novels, which were heavily &quot;edited&quot; by her father, Richard Lovell Edgeworth, before their publication, the published version is close to her original intention. Shortly before its publication, an introduction, glossary and footnotes, written in the voice of an English narrator, were added to the original text to blunt the negative impact the Edgeworths feared the book might have on English enthusiasm for the Act of Union 1800. Her main sources were her own family history called </span><span class="c5 c2">The Black Book of Edgeworthstown.</span><span class="c5">&nbsp;The novel is set prior to the Constitution of 1782. It is narrated by an Irish catholic worker on the estate, named Thady Quirk, and portrayed the rise of the catholic-Irish middle class. It tells the story of four generations of Rackrent heirs through their steward, Thady Quirk. The heirs are: the dissipated spendthrift Sir Patrick O&#39;Shaughlin, the litigious Sir Murtagh Rackrent, the cruel husband and gambling absentee Sir Kit Rackrent, and the generous but improvident Sir Condy Rackrent. Their sequential mismanagement of the estate is resolved through the machinations&mdash;and to the benefit&mdash;of the narrator&#39;s astute son, Jason Quirk. William Butler Yeats pronounced </span><span class="c5 c2">Castle Rackrent</span><span class="c13 c15 c5">&nbsp;&quot;one of the most inspired chronicles written in English&quot;. Walter Scot credited her novel for inspiring him to write his Waverley series of novels.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5 c2">Rosamond</span><span class="c13 c15 c5">&nbsp;(1801) &ldquo;The Purple Jar&rdquo; reappears in it.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5 c2 c20">Belinda </span><span class="c5">(1801) in three volumes. In its first (1801) and second (1802) editions, Juba, a Black servant, marries an English farmgirl named Lucy. The third edition of the book, published in 1810, omitted the character Juba, and instead has Lucy betrothed to one James Jackson. Also, in the first two editions, Belinda almost marries Mr. Vincent, a rich West Indian Creole; in the 1810 edition, Belinda only esteems him and never agrees to marry him. It has been argued that this change came at the insistence of Edgeworth&#39;s father, rather than the author herself, because he edited several of her works after their publication. Belinda is a young lady who lives with her aunt, Mrs. Stanhope. Being unwed, Belinda is sent to live with Lady Delacour, whom Belinda considers fascinating and charming. Lady Delacour believes herself to be dying of breast cancer. She hides her emotional distress caused by her impending death and poor relationships with her family from Belinda through wit and charm. The first half of the novel is concerned with the blooming friendship between Belinda and Lady Delacour, which is broken by Lady Delacour&#39;s fear that Belinda plans to marry Lord Delacour. Belinda subsequently moves to the home of the Percival family, the embodiment of the ideal family. Once Lady Delacour seeks treatment for her illness, Belinda returns to support her. Upon her visit to the doctor, Lady Delacour discovers her disease is not terminal and reconciles herself with Belinda. She eventually makes a full recovery from her illness.

The plot of the novel centres on the newly married Leonora and her decision to bring back to England a woman who had been exiled to France. The woman, Olivia, is known as a &quot;</span><span class="c15 c5 c14 c38">coquette,&quot; and her controversial behaviour with regard to her marriage had driven her to France, where she cultivated an aristocratic, &quot;French&quot; sensibility that exists apart from conventional morality.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5 c2">Tales of Fashionable Life</span><span class="c13 c15 c5">&nbsp;(1809 and 1812) 2-series collection of short stories which often focus on the life of a woman.

After this, Edgeworth was regarded as the preeminent female writer in England alongside Jane Austen.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5 c2 c20">Ennui</span><span class="c5">&nbsp;(1809) &nbsp;fictitious memoir of the Earl of Glenthorn</span><span class="c5 c14">&nbsp;an English man who experiences excessive boredom (</span><span class="c5">ennui) and attempts to find novelty and meaning in life.

Other such novels include &nbsp;Thomas Skinner Surr&#39;s </span><span class="c5 c14 c2">A Winter in London</span><span class="c15 c5 c14 c38">&nbsp;(1806). The earl experiences ennui, male counterpart of hysteria. His marriage is unhappy and culminates in divorce. He attempts to find novelty in life by gambling, eating food, and traveling; gambling is the only activity which brings him any excitement. He visits Ireland to find meaning in life and engages in democratic projects, yet he remains bored. Attempts suicide but fails. &nbsp;Following this reveal, he has a more fulfilling and appreciative life, which includes being remarried and taking on a new name.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5 c2 c20">The Absentee</span><span class="c5">&nbsp;(1812) in </span><span class="c5 c2">Tales of Fashionable Life</span><span class="c13 c15 c5">. Depicts the systemic evils of the absentee landlord class of Anglo-Irish and the desperate condition of the Irish peasantry. Lord Colambre, the sensitive hero of the novel, his father, Lord Clonbrony, is in serious debt as a result of his wife&#39;s lifestyle. The moneylender Mordecai who threatens foreclosure is anti-semitic depiction. Colambre has &nbsp;fallen in love with his cousin, Grace Nugent while his mother wants him to mary marry an heiress, Miss Broadhurst, for money. Feeling he will be pressed into doing so, he flees to his ancestral home in County Wicklow in Ireland. Befriends &nbsp;Sir James Brooke who warns him againt &nbsp;Lady Dashfort who is looking for a rich guy for her widowed daughter, Lady Isobel. Colambre falls under the influence of the persuasive Lady Dashfort, Getting wind of his feelings for Grace, Lady Dashfort slyly lets slip that Grace was born out of wedlock, and is therefore illegitimate which is confirmed by letter by his mother. He visits his family estate and discovers that his father&#39;s agents are oppressing the local peasantry and probably cheating his father as well. He reveals himself to the agents, and there is a race back to London, Colambre trying to stop his father from signing documents that would ruin some of the good peasants, (and would swindle Clonbrony and Colambre), the agents trying to get the papers signed. He rushes back and in time prevents the signing. &nbsp;He then assists his father in paying off his debts, on condition that the Clonbrony family returns to live in Ireland. The final section concerns Colambre&#39;s love for Grace and how it is discovered that she is both legitimate and an heiress.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5 c2 c20">Patronage</span><span class="c5">&nbsp;(1814</span><span class="c5 c14">) in four volumes, it is the longest of her novels. As a book is path-making; it was among the first novels with a </span><span class="c5">thesis and as such, it opened the way for </span><span class="c15 c5 c14 c38">Sir Walter Scott&#39;s historical novels. In the novel, Edgeworth focuses on and scrupulously explores the various types of patronage and the many forms it takes in all strata of English society.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5 c2 c20">Harrington</span><span class="c5">&nbsp;(1817) &nbsp;written in response to a letter from a Jewish-American reader who complained about Edgeworth&#39;s stereotypically anti-semitic portrayals of Jews in </span><span class="c5 c2">Castle Rackrent</span><span class="c5">&nbsp;(1800), </span><span class="c5 c2">Belinda</span><span class="c5">&nbsp;(1801), </span><span class="c5 c2">The Absentee</span><span class="c5">&nbsp;(1812), and her </span><span class="c5 c2">Moral Tales</span><span class="c5">&nbsp;(1801) for children. It&rsquo;s in the form of &nbsp;an autobiography of a &quot;recovering anti-Semite&quot;, whose youthful prejudices are undone by contact with various Jewish characters, particularly a young woman. Set between the Jewish Naturalisation Act of 1753 and the Gordon Riots of 1780, the timeframe highlights these connections. Harrington, the protagonist, explores his memories to better understand his views on Jews. The novel begins with Harrington&#39;s early image of Jews, formed by stories told by his maid of &quot;Simon the Jew&quot;. Harrington remarks that the stories were &quot;used upon every occasion to reduce me to passive obedience.&quot; His parents further strengthen this image by rewarding Harrington&#39;s antisemitism. Only after attending public school and meeting the bully Mowbray are Harrington&#39;s views on Jews changed. Mowbray&#39;s tormenting of the Jewish peddler Jacob causes this sudden shift in thinking. The story shifts to a romance novel with the introduction of Berenice Montenero, an American Jew who moved to England with her wealthy father. Harrington&#39;s family and friends are alarmed at his (Harrington&#39;s) choice of a Jewish woman, a relationship further impeded by the advances of Harrington&#39;s old rival Mowbray. Seeking marriage into a wealthy family, Mowbray&#39;s attempts to court Berenice are denied. As revenge, Mowbray brings charges of insanity against Harrington, a situation further compounded by his family threatening to disown him. To marry Berenice, Harrington must overcome these obstacles and prove himself to Mr. Montenero. He is thus tested &quot;by experiences designed to arouse his enthusiasm and fear.&quot;</span><span class="c5 c56">[4]</span><span class="c13 c15 c5">&nbsp;Mowbray is exposed as the culprit behind Harrington&#39;s supposed insanity and Harrington is deemed worthy of marriage to Berenice. This strange courtship is concluded with the revelation by Mr. Montenero, &quot;I have tried you to the utmost, and am satisfied both of the steadiness of your principles and of the strength of your attachment to my daughter-Berenice is not a Jewess.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5 c2 c20">Ormond</span><span class="c5">&nbsp;(1817</span><span class="c5 c14">) It tells the story of Harry Ormond, a hero who rises from poverty to wealth. Set both in Ireland and France, the novel uses different places to represent different paths that Ormond might take and different political ideologies. Ireland and France are shown as linked through their revolutionary fervour. In 1798, France had sent aid to the </span><span class="c5">United Irishmen and this tie is hinted at through Ormond&#39;s travels. However, in the end Ormond chooses to serve in Britain&#39;s military, thus signalling Ireland&#39;s ties with England rather than its independence or its ties to France.

Taken in by local vicar as no relatives come forward. Later the Davenant family comes and she is to live with their daughter Cecilia Davenant who has just married general Clarendon in Clarendon Park. Helen journeys to join her dear friend Cecilia (a charming socialite), and the first half of the novel describes Helen&#39;s experiences among the most fortunate of Britain&#39;s elite under the tutelage of Lady Davenant, who in some ways favors Helen over her own daughter Cecilia. In the second and more dramatic half of the novel, Lady Davenant departs with her husband, who has been named ambassador at the Court of St. Petersburg, Russia. Helen is left to the care of General Clarendon and Cecilia. Helen is engaged to Granville Beauclerc. The amorous letters that Celia exchanged with &nbsp;Colonel d&#39;Aubigny (now dead) one day end up addressed to her husband and Cecilia asks her to pretend they are hers. This &nbsp;finally means that Helen&#39;s reputation is in tatters. Beauclerc is forced to fight a </span><span class="c15 c5 c14 c38">duel in defense of his fianc&eacute;e, after which he must flee from England. Helen also thinks it better to take exile in Wales with the General&#39;s sister rather than be humiliated. Cecilia now has a son yet she doesn&rsquo;t reveal the truth. The d&eacute;nouement comes when Lady Davenant, also dangerously ill, returns to London at the same time as the General finally discovers his wife&#39;s deception and vows to separate from Cecilia for life. Helen&#39;s character is redeemed, Beauclerc returns to England when his adversary recovers from his wounds, and the novel ends happily for all the protagonists with Lady Davenant saying that she is &quot;now, and not till now, happy--perfectly happy in Love and Truth!&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c15 c5 c16">Non Fiction</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5">&nbsp;</span><span class="c5 c2">Letters for Literary Ladies</span><span class="c13 c15 c5">&nbsp;in 1795 her first publication is a response to Thomas Day&#39;s, a member of the Lunar Society, belief that women should not be authors or taught to think.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c13 c15 c5">&quot;An Essay on the Noble Science of Self-Justification&quot; (1795) is written for a female audience in which she convinces women that the fair sex is endowed with an art of self-justification and women should use their gifts to continually challenge the force and power of men, especially their husbands, with wit and intelligence.

Henry finds and questions her; he surmises and informs her that his father loved his wife in his own way and was truly upset by her death.

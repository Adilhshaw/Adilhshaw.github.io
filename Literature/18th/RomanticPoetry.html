imitation of human nature with the dual aim of edification and pleasure is taken over by a keen focus on the personality of the poet rather than the audience. The ambivalent attitude is seen is sSamuel Johnson. The poetry of this age has melancholy, change (due to industrialization of previous century) and restlessness of Queen Anne&rsquo;s rule, further fueled by Rousseau&rsquo;s thought. Gray cannot be seen merely as a pre-romantic figure as his diction is not directly related to WWW&rsquo;s real language of men which bears semblance to 18th century poets like Akenside and Thomson. Civilisation isn&rsquo;t seen as taming of crude humanity but restrictions on personality which are intolerable (as depicted in Blake). The demands of urban gentility as seen as restraints on individuality. Primitive and the heroic violence became interesting.</span></p><p class="c23"><span>Influential essays were Robert Wood&rsquo;s </span><span class="c1">Essay on the Original Genius and Wriotings of Homer </span><span class="c3 c15">(1769)</span></p><p class="c23"><span>The language of WWW (in his Preface) is closer to Addison&rsquo;s 1712 dictum of poets needing to &ldquo;guard against idiomatic ways of speaking&rdquo; as these obvious phrases are passed through vulgar mouths. Thus while Dryden and Pope see poetry as language of gentlemen, WWW (1800) sees it fit to be the language of rustics who are &ldquo;less under restraint&rdquo;. Thus poetry of the sort of ballads and folk poetry is scelebrated as true expression in Thomas Percy&rsquo;s </span><span class="c1">Reliques of English Poetry </span><span class="c3 c15">(1765). These poets wre impacted by French Revolution and its promise, cramming of cities and thus wanted to be nearer natural expression.</span></p><p class="c23"><span>The two branches that romantic movement was to take was calculated simplicity ( a reaction to Lord Chesterfield&rsquo;s programme) as well as calculated exoticism (as can be seen in </span><span class="c1">LB</span><span class="c3 c15">&nbsp;1998). Coleridge was the first important critic of English language. For him propriety in poetry evolves out of a specific poem rather than feelings of society. Poem thus is seen as an organic whole referring back to the poet rathen tha to the audience being targetted. </span></p><p class="c23 c31"><span class="c3 c15"></span></p><h1 class="c19 c34" id="h.7bjodd2950lk"><span class="c3 c30">Romanticism I</span></h1><p class="c9 c33"><span class="c3 c7">Blake an antithesis of Augustan position in Lord Chesterfield&rsquo;s letter to son.

He rejects an &quot;Arab maiden&quot; in his search for an idealised embodiment of a woman as he dreams of a &quot;veiled maid&quot; who becomes symbol of supernatural. He wants to unite nature with this supernatural he tasted in the dream. The night&#39;s blackness swallows the vision and severs his dreamy link to the supernatural. Once touched by the maddening hand of the supernatural, the Poet restlessly searches for a reconciliation with his lost vision. In frustration, thoughts of death as the possible next step. Poet notices a small boat (&quot;little shallop&quot;) floating down a nearby river. Rows and goes deeper into the nature. Like the water&#39;s surface supports the boat, the supernatural world &quot;cradles&quot; the mutability both of nature and of man. His imagination helps him sense the spirit&#39;s supernatural presence. The boat flows onward to an &quot;immeasurable void&quot; and the Poet finds himself ready to sink into the supernatural world and break through the threshold into death. &nbsp;He reaches the &quot;obscurest chasm,&quot; his last sight is of the moon. He has attained transcendence to the supernatural world.

The plot centres on two characters named Laon and Cythna, inhabitants of Argolis under Ottoman rule who initiate a revolution against its despotic ruler. The work is a symbolic parable on liberation and revolutionary idealism following the disillusionment of the French Revolution. In the Preface, he explains: &ldquo; It is an experiment on the temper of the public mind, as to how far a thirst for a happier condition of moral and political society survives, among the enlightened and refined, the tempests which have shaken the age in which we live.&rdquo; The poet sees a fight of eagle and snake on a mountain and an elderly woman resuces the snake and the poet. Laon and Cythna live in daydreams of delight. But soon attacked by Ottomon army and Cynthia is taken while Laon imprisone to be freed later by a hermit and then taken to an island where he lives with an old man.

They then board the Count&#39;s gondola and pass a lunatic asylum, which provokes from Maddalo a comparison between the inmates&#39; situation and the futility of all mortal life. Maddalo dismisses Julian&#39;s creed as utopian, and compares him with a former friend who has since gone mad known as the Maniac. They again take the gondola to the madhouse to meet this man, the Maniac, who tells them a confused and disconnected account of an ill-fated romance and of his abandonment by his lover.

A Tragedy, in Five Acts</span><span class="c3 c0">&nbsp;(1820) a verse drama in five acts about real-life Roman family, the House of Cenci. The play was not considered stageable in its day due to its themes of incest and parricide, and was not performed in public in England until 1922. In its preface, Shelley explains that he wrote Beatrice as a &ldquo;tragic character&rdquo; by not making her think &ldquo;revenge, retaliation, atonement&rdquo; are mistakes which would have made her wiser but not tragic. Count Francesco Cenci is implicated in a murder case and Cardinal Camillo discusses that if he gives 1/3 of his possession to church, he is saved. He sent his sons Rocco and Cristofano, to Salamanca, Spain in the expectation that they will die of starvation. His daughter Beatrice and her lover Orsino try to raise people against his brutalities. Beatrice is raped. They attempt along with Beatrice&rsquo;s stepmother Lucretia an assassination but fail. Later, use their servants Olimpio and Marzio for it who strangle the Count, throw his body out of the room off the balcony, where it is entangled in a pine. In the meantime, the otder from Pope comes to arrest Cenci but he is murdered so they all get punished and are to be executed (with Orsino escaping). Beatrice&rsquo;s &nbsp;final words are: &quot;We are quite ready. Well, &#39;tis very well.&quot;</span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c0">&nbsp;Oscar Wilde concluded: &quot;In fact no one has more clearly understood than Shelley the mission of the dramatist and the meaning of the drama.&quot; Byron wrote his criticisms of the play in a letter to Shelley: &quot;I read </span><span class="c0 c1">Cenci</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;&ndash; but, besides that I think the subject essentially un-dramatic, I am not a great admirer of our old dramatists as models.

The original myth is that Aphrodite punishes Psyche, an admirable girl, by asking Cupid to make her fall for him. He instead falls for her and goes to meet her in dark so he could hide identity. She later seeks him everywhere and has to do tasks. Finally Zeus asks Aphrodite to transform her into a goddess so she could be with her love. But it has nothing to do with the myth (Bloom). The poem begins with a narrator witnessing two individuals embracing in a forest: &ldquo; But who wast thou, O happy, happy dove? / His Psyche true!&rdquo; He finds Psyche to be better than other worshipped goddesses and resolves to be her priest; &ldquo;I see, and sing, by my own eyes inspired.&rdquo; Now he will open his mind to &ldquo;let the warm love in&rdquo;. Leigh Hunt declared that &quot;When Mr Keats errs in his poetry, it is from the ill management of the good things,--exuberance of ideas.

The poem is about a fairy who condemns a knight to an unpleasant fate after she seduces him with her eyes and singing.

In Agatha Christie&#39;s 1936 mystery novel </span><span class="c0 c1">Murder in Mesopotamia</span><span class="c0">, the plot is centered upon an unusual woman named Louise Leidner who is described multiple times as &quot;a kind of Belle Dame sin Merci&quot;.

The poem tells how the god Hermes hears of a nymph who is more beautiful than all. Hermes, searching for the nymph, instead comes across Lamia, trapped in the form of a serpent. She reveals the previously invisible nymph to him and in return he restores her human form. She goes to seek a youth of Corinth, Lycius, while Hermes and his nymph depart together into the woods. The relationship between Lycius and Lamia, however, is destroyed when the sage Apollonius reveals Lamia&#39;s true identity at their wedding feast, whereupon she seemingly disappears and Lycius dies of grief. These lines have shown what Newton did to poetry: &ldquo;There was an awful rainbow once in heaven: / We know her woof, her texture; she is given&rdquo;. At the &quot;immortal dinner party&quot; held by Benjamin Haydon on 28 December 1817, Keats agreed with Charles Lamb that Newton &quot;had destroyed all the poetry of the rainbow, by reducing it to the prismatic colours&quot;.</span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c4 c1">Isabella; or the Pot of Basil</span><span class="c0 c1">&nbsp;</span><span class="c0">(written right after </span><span class="c0 c1">Endymion</span><span class="c0">) </span><span class="c0">uses ottava rima.

Madeline pines for the love of Porphyro (sworn family enemy) and she has heard that on the eve, if a woman dreams of her lover, she will have him. So she starts dreaming of Porphyro. Porphyro comes and askes Agnes to show him her room where he wants to have a glance. He sees her ready for bed and upon seeing him she accepts him in her bed. They later flee the castle. Angela is dead in the end of the poem. H.P.

It stops abruptly in the middle of the third book. He gave it up as having &quot;too many Miltonic inversions.&quot; The poem opens with Saturn bemoaning the loss of his power, which is being overtaken by Jupiter. Thea leads him to a place where the other Titans sit, similarly miserable, and they discuss whether they should fight back against their conquest by the new gods. Oceanus declares that he is willing to surrender his power to Neptune</span><span class="c7">&nbsp;as he&rsquo;s </span><span class="c3 c0">more beautiful; Clymene describes first hearing the music of Apollo, which she found beautiful to the point of pain. Finally, Enceladus makes a speech encouraging the Titans to fight. Hyperion is the only Titan who is still powerful. The scene changes to Apollo (the new sun god, also god of music, civilisation and culture) weeping on the beach. Here Mnemosyne (goddess of memory) encounters him and he explains to her the cause of his tears: he is aware of his divine potential, but as yet unable to fulfill it. By looking into Mnemosyne&#39;s eyes he receives knowledge which transforms him fully into a god. The poem as usually printed breaks off at this point, in mid-line, with the word &quot;celestial&quot;. Keats&#39;s friend Richard Woodhouse, transcribing this poem, completed this line as &quot;Celestial Glory dawn&#39;d: he was a god!&quot; Opening by Hyperion: &ldquo;Saturn is fallen, am I too to fall? / Am I to leave this haven of my rest,&rdquo; ***</span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c4 c1">The Fall of Hyperion: A Dream</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;(1856)</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;abandoned before Keats&#39;s death.

After enjoying the sensory delight, he is compelled to partake of a &quot;cool vessel of transparent juice&quot; that causes him to fall into a deep sleep. He opens his eyes and finds himself before a temple, with the gates to the East (the same direction as the gates of Eden) shut. Moneta, a mysterious figure challenges him to climb upon stairs, which he experiences a painful death that is reminiscent of Apollo&#39;s pain when &quot;dying into life&quot; in </span><span class="c0 c1">Hyperion</span><span class="c0">. Once the poet narrator makes it up the steps, he is questioned thoroughly by Moneta on the nature of poetry, on visions, and what one must do with their life, which reflects the second part of </span><span class="c0 c1">Sleep and Poetry</span><span class="c0">, where the narrator has to condemn the false poets in each. Once the poet has passed the test, Moneta allows the poet to witness a vision of the Titans and of Hyperion.

The main story tells of a member of Hassan&#39;s harem, Leila, who loves the giaour and is killed by being drowned in the sea by Hassan. In revenge, the giaour kills Hassan and then enters a monastery due to his remorse. It reflects the gloom, remorse, and lust of two illicit love affairs, one with his half-sister </span><span class="c21">Augusta Leigh and the other with Lady Frances Webster.

He, in turn, decries Giaffir&#39;s judgment as well and vows vengeance. Later, Selim is dressed as a dashing pirate and declares that Zuleika is not his sister. Reveals to Zuleika Giaffir had killed Abdallah, Selim&#39;s father and Giaffir&#39;s brother. Knew his identity from one of his father&#39;s loyal servants, Haroun. He became a pirate so that he could gather a posse for revenge, and asserts his lust for Giaffir&#39;s blood. He is later seen dying on the beach, the fatal blow administered by Giaffir himself.

Conrad learns that his wife, Medora, believing Conrad had died in Seyd&#39;s counterattack, has died of grief.

Byron recounts the final, desperate resistance of the Venetians on the day the Ottoman army stormed Acrocorinth: revealing the closing scenes of the conflict through the eyes of Alp (a Venetian renegade fighting for the Ottomans) and Francesca (the beautiful maiden daughter of the governor of the Venetian garrison: Minotti). They both are narrators. Minotti doesn&rsquo;t let Alp (originally called Lanciotto) marry Francesa, his daughter. He resolves to fight under the Turkish flag and repudiates both his nationality and his religion, as well as his old name &#39;Lanciotto&#39;, only to be challenged by Francesca herself the night before the final assault to repent his apostasy, to forgive his accusers, and to save the Venetian garrison from certain slaughter.

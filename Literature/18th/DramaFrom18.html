Unusual for featuring middle/working-class characters; hugely popular in the 18th century. Inspired by a 17th-century Shropshire murder ballad. Lillo emphasized moral instruction in his preface: praised tragedy as &quot;excellent and useful.&quot; Title possibly twists Francis Beaumont&#39;s </span><span class="c2 c6">Knight of the Burning Pestle</span><span class="c2">; both honor common citizens in drama.

Referenced in Mill&#39;s </span><span class="c2 c6">On Liberty</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;to discuss punishment for wrongdoing (Barnwell&#39;s murder). PLOT: Sarah Millwood, a manipulative prostitute, targets naive clerk George Barnwell, seduces him and coerces him into stealing from his employer, Thorowgood. Overcome by guilt, George confesses to his friend Trueman but flees, turning to Millwood, who persuades him to rob and murder his wealthy uncle. George kills his uncle, who forgives him before dying. Thorowgood learns of the crimes through Millwood&rsquo;s servant, Lucy and Millwood betrays George to the police when he fails her. Both are arrested; Millwood, unrepentant, blames society, while George, remorseful, accepts his fate with forgiveness and spiritual solace. The play ends with a moral reflection on avoiding ruinous choices.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c5 c6">The Christian Hero</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;(1735): tragedy based on the life of&nbsp;</span><span class="c2 c3"><a class="c0" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skanderbeg&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1736319756116546&amp;usg=AOvVaw0O-bTp0T0S6isAX2YxhMqA">Skanderbeg</a></span><span class="c2">&nbsp;who&nbsp;</span><span class="c2 c3"><a class="c0" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skanderbeg%2527s_rebellion&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1736319756116727&amp;usg=AOvVaw3_ALQs_e-lua14evwEHZxm">led a rebellion</a></span><span class="c2">&nbsp;against the&nbsp;</span><span class="c2 c3"><a class="c0" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ottoman_Empire&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1736319756116898&amp;usg=AOvVaw2obR_tR_OCJ3MUpkuFUQPd">Ottoman Empire</a></span><span class="c2">&nbsp;in the&nbsp;</span><span class="c2 c3"><a class="c0" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fifteenth_century&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1736319756117114&amp;usg=AOvVaw2S3ul7ad296DILK4fZC8SX">fifteenth century</a></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c5 c6">Fatal Curiosity</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;(1737): tragedy alternative title&nbsp;</span><span class="c5 c6">Guilt Its Own Punishment</span><span class="c2">. the work attacks the government and Imperial strategy of&nbsp;</span><span class="c2 c3"><a class="c0" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Walpole&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1736319756117547&amp;usg=AOvVaw0di2OlaviG9WMU5ZfARyzR">Robert Walpole</a></span><span class="c2">.

His works remain central to the Western literary canon.

Setting: 18th-century Bath, known for wealth, fashion and &quot;taking the waters&quot;. Less exclusive than London, ideal for the characters. The plot revolves around Lydia Languish, a romantic young woman and Jack Absolute, who pretends to be the poor Ensign Beverley to win her love. Lydia&rsquo;s guardian, Mrs. Malaprop, a moralistic widow known for her malapropisms, disapproves of the romance. Lydia has two other suitors: Bob Acres, a buffoonish country gentleman and Sir Lucius O&#39;Trigger, a poor Irishman manipulated into thinking Lydia is interested in him. Jack learns that his father, Sir Anthony, has arranged a marriage with Lydia but pretends to accept to avoid conflict. Jack reveals his true identity to Lydia, but she rejects him for Beverley. Meanwhile, Faulkland, Jack&rsquo;s friend, is overly jealous of Julia, leading to misunderstandings. Sir Lucius convinces Acres to duel Beverley, unaware it&#39;s Jack. At the duel, Acres hesitates, but Sir Lucius insists. Jack is ready to duel Sir Lucius, but Acres backs out when he learns Beverley is Jack. The duel proceeds and Sir Lucius realizes he&rsquo;s been duped when Lydia confesses her love for Jack. Mrs. Malaprop admits she&rsquo;s Delia and Sir Lucius is embarrassed.

O&#39;Connor and his men are billeted in the town where the Justice lives, but Lauretta&#39;s jealous father prevents them from meeting often. O&#39;Connor&#39;s men complain about poor treatment at inns and suggest eloping with Lauretta to end the matter. Dr. Rosy, a sentimental man mourning his wife, helps O&#39;Connor with a plan to elope. Lauretta secretly favors O&#39;Connor, confides in her mother, who warns against marrying a soldier. Justice Credulous hires a servant to protect Lauretta from the Lieutenant&#39;s advances. O&#39;Connor disguises himself as &quot;Honest Humphrey Hum,&quot; a naive rustic and is entrusted with guarding Lauretta. O&#39;Connor reveals his true identity, leading to an angry confrontation with the Justice, who threatens to shoot him. O&#39;Connor devises a new plan, disguising himself as a German quack and falsely claiming that the Justice has been poisoned. The Justice, terrified, seeks Dr. Rosy, who affirms the poisoning and insists on O&#39;Connor&#39;s help for an antidote. O&#39;Connor demands three thousand pounds and permission to marry Lauretta. Justice Credulous, believing Lauretta will never consent, agrees to O&#39;Connor&#39;s terms. The Justice is outwitted when Lauretta agrees to the marriage and the play ends with the couple&#39;s union. Justice Credulous reluctantly withdraws his objections and the affair becomes a source of lifelong domestic conflict.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c5 c6">The Duenna </span><span class="c2">(1775): a three-act comic opera.

He learns that Foppington is set to marry Miss Hoyden, the daughter of Sir Tunbelly Clumsey, though they&#39;ve never met, communicating through go-between Dame Coupler. Tom plans to marry her for her fortune with help from Colonel Townley and Loveless, who is angry at Foppington for wooing his wife, Amanda. Townley tests Berinthia&rsquo;s fidelity by pretending to woo Amanda, which backfires when Loveless persecutes Berinthia. As their issues resolve, Tom moves forward with his plan, gaining letters from Dame Coupler and ingratiating himself with Sir Tunbelly, who agrees to the marriage. Tom bribes Hoyden&rsquo;s nurse to marry quickly, ahead of Foppington&rsquo;s arrival.

Lady Sneerwell, a wealthy widow, plots to ruin Maria&rsquo;s romance with Charles by spreading rumors about Charles and Lady Teazle. Sir Peter Teazle complains about his wife&rsquo;s spending and praises Joseph, his respectable ward, who courts Maria. Sir Oliver, the brothers&#39; rich uncle, returns from the East Indies and plans to test his nephews&rsquo; characters in disguise. Sir Peter pressures Maria to marry Joseph while Sir Oliver, disguised as Mr. Premium, finds Charles living recklessly, selling family valuables to pay debts. Lady Teazle secretly flirts with Joseph, but later regrets it. Sir Oliver forgives Charles after he refuses to sell a portrait of Sir Oliver. Joseph, disguised as Mr. Stanley, deceives Sir Peter about his wealth, but when Sir Oliver reveals his true identity, Joseph&rsquo;s hypocrisy is exposed. Lady Sneerwell&rsquo;s malicious schemes are unraveled, clearing Charles. Maria and Charles are reconciled and Joseph and Lady Sneerwell are disgraced. The play ends with Lady Teazle withdrawing from high society and Charles indicating reform, with a humorous epilogue by George Colman the Elder reflecting on Lady Teazle&rsquo;s regrets and a parody of Shakespeare&#39;s Othello. </span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c1">William Hazlitt praised Sheridan&#39;s comedies: &quot;everything in them tells; there is no labour in vain&quot;.

Ada&rsquo;s father, Mr. Ingot, asks Garrick to cure Ada&rsquo;s infatuation. Garrick agrees but promises not to romance her. At a dinner, Garrick realizes Ada is the girl he admires, but he pretends to be a drunk gambler to help her get over him. Ada is heartbroken but agrees to marry Chivy.

Ada goes to Garrick&rsquo;s house to stop the duel, but Chivy follows her and she hides. Garrick plays along, leaving for the duel with Chivy. Ingot finds Ada and disowns her, causing her to faint.

At a houseparty, she flirts with Edward Falkner, who falls in love with her. Sir Christopher Deering tries to intervene, but Jessica enjoys Falkner&rsquo;s affection. When Gilbert leaves, Jessica meets Falkner for dinner. Gilbert&rsquo;s brother, George, sees them and wires Gilbert. Jessica and Rosamund cover up by sending Gilbert a letter.

The plot revolves around Mrs. Dane, a widow betrothed to Lionel, the adopted son of Sir Daniel, a prominent judge. Rumors spread that Mrs. Dane is actually Felicia Hindermarsh, involved in a scandalous affair with a married man in Vienna. Before allowing the marriage, Sir Daniel seeks to investigate her past and clear her name, enlisting Lady Eastney and others in the process. Mrs. Dane presents convincing evidence of her innocence, but during a cross-examination, she accidentally reveals her true identity as Felicia Hindermarsh when she slips up about a cousin. Sir Daniel&#39;s professional inquiry uncovers the truth and though Lady Eastney intervenes to keep the secret, Mrs. Dane&rsquo;s marriage to Lionel is called off. In the end, Mrs. Dane is exiled from the village, restoring her reputation but marking her social punishment. The play reflects the late Victorian/Edwardian &quot;fallen woman&quot; trope, where women with a scandalous past are punished, though in this case, through exile rather than death or suicide, which distinguishes it from other works of the period.</span></p><p class="c29"><span class="c5 c6">Joseph Entangled</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;(1904); </span><span class="c5 c6">The Hypocrites </span><span class="c2">(1906); </span><span class="c5 c6">The Lie </span><span class="c2">(1914); </span><span class="c5 c6">Cock o&#39; the Walk</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;(1915); </span><span class="c5 c6">The Pacifists</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;(1917)</span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c1"></span></p><h2 class="c9"><span class="c12 c5 c11">Arthur Wing Pinero (1855&ndash;1934)</span></h2><p class="c29"><span class="c1">English playwright drawn to theatre from an early age, becoming a professional actor at 19. He wrote his first play in 1877 and, by 1884, had written 15 plays, including three successes, prompting him to leave acting for full-time writing. </span></p><p class="c29"><span class="c2">He gained fame with farces like </span><span class="c5 c6">The Magistrate</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;(1885) and later turned to serious topics in the 1890s. </span><span class="c5 c6">The Second Mrs Tanqueray</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;(1893), about a woman&rsquo;s scandalous past, was controversial but profitable.

His libretto for </span><span class="c5 c6">The Beauty Stone</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;(1898) failed, leading him to focus on society dramas and comedies. Between 1884 and 1893, he produced six farces and five comedies, including </span><span class="c5 c6">The Schoolmistress</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;(1886), </span><span class="c5 c6">Dandy Dick</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;(1887), </span><span class="c5 c3 c6"><a class="c0" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Cabinet_Minister&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1736319756138410&amp;usg=AOvVaw1mz-7C7b6-vSOcz_T24RQ5">The Cabinet Minister</a></span><span class="c2">&nbsp;(1890) and </span><span class="c5 c6">The Amazons</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;(1893). His serious works, like </span><span class="c5 c6">The Profligate</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;(1889), explored moral double standards. Pinero, often compared to Shaw, emphasized characters over didactic themes. Criticized by Shaw for focusing on personal impact of social issues over didactic arguments. Early 20th-century successes included </span><span class="c5 c6">Iris</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;(1901), </span><span class="c5 c6">The &quot;Mind the Paint&quot; Girl</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;(1912) and </span><span class="c5 c6">The Big Drum</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;(1915).

Posket is married to Agatha, a widow who lied about her age (36 &rarr; 31) and her son Cis&rsquo;s age (19 &rarr; 14) to seem younger. Cis, precocious and mischievous, flirts, gambles, and smokes, unaware of his real age. Agatha&rsquo;s sister Charlotte, recovering from a broken engagement, is staying with them. Colonel Lukyn, Posket&rsquo;s old friend and Cis&rsquo;s godfather, knows Agatha&rsquo;s true age. Agatha secretly visits Lukyn to prevent him from exposing her, while Cis convinces Posket to join him at H&ocirc;tel des Princes. There, Lukyn dines with Captain Vale, Charlotte&rsquo;s ex-fianc&eacute;. Agatha and Charlotte meet Lukyn, leading to a reconciliation between Charlotte and Vale. A police raid ensues; Posket and Cis escape but are pursued through chaotic streets, while Agatha and others are arrested. The next day, Posket unknowingly sentences Agatha to prison but learns of her deception at home. The farce resolves with forgiveness and highlights societal pretensions through absurd humor and misunderstandings.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c5 c6">The Schoolmistress</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;(1886): a farce set at a girls&#39; boarding school while the headmistress is away.

Dinah Rankling, a pupil, is secretly married to Reginald Paulover, whose proposal for her hand is rejected by her parents. In her absence, Queckett invites friends, including Lieut.

Queckett spends money meant for rent and servants on the party. Mallory and Rankling arrive, unaware that Dinah is secretly married and a fire breaks out during the party.

The plot, controversial for its morality, centers on Sophy Fullgarney, a manicurist engaged to the palmist Frank Pollitt (&quot;Valma&quot;). Sophy, who is against her foster-sister Muriel Eden&rsquo;s marriage to the notorious Quex, prefers the charming Captain Bastling as a suitor. At a country house, the Duchess of Strood, an old flame of Quex, invites him to a private drink, leading Sophy to spy on them. Although innocent, the encounter appears scandalous. Quex, caught by Sophy, bribes her to remain silent, but she remains unmoved, insisting he isn&rsquo;t truly reformed. He locks the door to avoid a scandal, convincing Sophy that his reformation is genuine. Sophy, in turn, agrees not to oppose his marriage to Muriel.

Gilbert (libretto), satirizing the aesthetic movement of 1870s&ndash;80s England, along with fads, vanity, hypocrisy, romantic love, rural simplicity and military pomp. The aesthetic movement, rooted in &ldquo;Art for Art&rsquo;s Sake,&rdquo; prioritized beauty over moral or social concerns in literature and art. This opera, the sixth of fourteen Gilbert and Sullivan collaborations, follows the antics of a group of lovesick maidens infatuated with Bunthorne, a sham aesthetic poet who secretly loves the simple milkmaid Patience. Patience, never having loved, meets childhood crush Archibald Grosvenor, an ideal aesthetic poet. They love each other but part as her love for his perfection would be selfish. Bunthorne raffles himself to his admirers, but Patience selflessly offers to marry him, only for the maidens to abandon Bunthorne for Grosvenor. In Act II, Lady Jane laments aging and Dragoons adopt aestheticism to win back fianc&eacute;es. Bunthorne forces Grosvenor to become &ldquo;commonplace,&rdquo; leading the maidens to embrace ordinariness and return to their lovers. Patience marries Grosvenor, the Duke weds Jane and Bunthorne is left alone.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c5 c3 c6"><a class="c0" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brantinghame_Hall&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1736319756150091&amp;usg=AOvVaw2CJqkRQz4zeU9wluOFkb3Y">Brantinghame Hal</a></span><span class="c2 c3 c6"><a class="c0" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brantinghame_Hall&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1736319756150194&amp;usg=AOvVaw18f9_5D2M0i1wRK9thcDIW">l</a></span><span class="c2">&nbsp;(1888): a drama.

Believing her husband unfaithful, Lady Windermere decides to leave him for Lord Darlington, who has confessed his love for her. Mrs. Erlynne, discovering this, follows Lady Windermere to Lord Darlington&#39;s house and persuades her to return home. To protect Lady Windermere&rsquo;s reputation, Mrs. Erlynne allows herself to be discovered in a compromising position at Lord Darlington&rsquo;s, giving Lady Windermere the chance to leave unnoticed. It is revealed that Mrs. Erlynne is Lady Windermere&rsquo;s estranged mother, who abandoned her family 20 years earlier. Mrs. Erlynne sacrifices her own reputation to save her daughter&rsquo;s marriage. </span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c5 c6">Salom&eacute;</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;(1893): one-act tragedy.

Salome attempts to seduce Jokanaan, but he rejects her, calling her the &ldquo;daughter of Sodom.&rdquo; The captain, unable to bear Salome&#39;s desire for Jokanaan, kills himself. Herod becomes fixated on Salome, rejecting her advances. Jokanaan continues denouncing Herodias, sparking a dispute among Jews about God. Herod promises Salome anything in exchange for a dance; she performs the dance of the seven veils. Salome requests Jokanaan&rsquo;s head on a silver platter.

Set in 1893, it revolves around a social gathering at Lady Hunstanton&rsquo;s estate, where gossip and small talk dominate. The plot unfolds as Gerald Arbuthnot is offered a promising position as Lord Illingworth&#39;s secretary, a career opportunity that seems to guarantee his success. However, tension arises when Gerald&rsquo;s mother, Mrs. Arbuthnot, reveals that Illingworth is actually Gerald&rsquo;s estranged father, whom she once loved but was abandoned by. Illingworth, a cynical and flirtatious man, has no interest in his son, and the play delves into the repercussions of past decisions, with Mrs. Arbuthnot&rsquo;s sacrifice and strength juxtaposed against Illingworth&rsquo;s cold disregard. In the final act, after a failed attempt by Gerald to have Illingworth marry his mother, Mrs. Arbuthnot rejects Illingworth&#39;s offer and slaps him, declaring him a &quot;man of no importance.&quot; The play explores themes of hypocrisy, class and personal integrity and despite its initial failure, remains a poignant critique of societal and personal values.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c5 c6">An Ideal Husband</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;(1895): a four-act play by Oscar Wilde, explores themes of blackmail, political corruption and the tension between public and private honor. Set in Sir Robert Chiltern&rsquo;s house, the play begins with a party where Sir Robert, a junior government minister, is blackmailed by Mrs. Cheveley, who threatens to expose his past crime of selling a Cabinet secret to Baron Arnheim. She demands his support for a fraudulent canal project and when Sir Robert submits to her demands, his wife, Lady Chiltern, insists he must remain morally impeccable. In the second act, Goring advises Sir Robert to confess, revealing his past connection with Mrs. Cheveley and urges Lady Chiltern to be more forgiving. Mrs. Cheveley exposes Sir Robert&#39;s past to Lady Chiltern, who denounces him. In Act III, Goring receives a letter from Lady Chiltern asking for help, which could be misunderstood as a love note. Mrs. Cheveley attempts to blackmail Goring into marriage in exchange for Sir Robert&rsquo;s incriminating letter, but Goring traps her by revealing her theft of a brooch and forcing her to trade the letter for her release. In Act IV, Goring proposes to Mabel and Sir Robert denounces the canal scheme in Parliament. Lady Chiltern&rsquo;s letter, misinterpreted by Sir Robert, leads to their reconciliation. Goring convinces Lady Chiltern not to let her husband resign and Sir Robert finally accepts Goring&rsquo;s marriage proposal for Mabel. H.G. Wells, in </span><span class="c2 c6">The Pall Mall Gazette</span><span class="c2">, criticized the play, calling it disappointing compared to </span><span class="c2 c6">Lady Windermere&#39;s Fan</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;and </span><span class="c2 c6">The Woman of No Importance</span><span class="c2">. Shaw praised Wilde, calling him &quot;our only thorough playwright.&quot; In 1996, critic Bindon Russell described </span><span class="c2 c6">An Ideal Husband</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;as Wilde&#39;s most autobiographical play, reflecting his own double life and scandalous secrets. Gertrude Chiltern was seen as a portrait of Wilde&#39;s wife, Constance.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c5 c6">The Importance of Being Earnest</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;(1895): his last of four drawing-room comedies. It&rsquo;s a farcical comedy about two young men who lead double lives, both using the name &quot;Ernest&quot; to avoid social obligations. They both court two young women, who are both in love with &quot;Ernest.&quot; Wilde scholars cite W. S. Gilbert&#39;s 1877 farce </span><span class="c2 c6">Engaged</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;as a key influence on the play. Shaw described the play as &quot;extremely funny&quot; but &quot;heartless,&quot; a view he held lifelong. Set in 1895, it is a comedy about mistaken identities and societal expectations. Jack Worthing lives a double life, posing as &quot;Ernest&quot; in London and &quot;Jack&quot; in the country, while Algernon Moncrieff also leads a double life, pretending to have a sick friend to avoid obligations. Jack proposes to Gwendolen, but she will only marry him if his name is Ernest. Meanwhile, Jack&rsquo;s young ward, Cecily, is charmed by Algernon, who pretends to be Ernest. Both women later discover they are engaged to men who are not who they claim to be. The confusion is resolved when Jack learns he is actually Ernest, the long-lost son of Lady Bracknell&rsquo;s sister and his marriage to Gwendolen is approved. The couples are united and Jack concludes that he now understands the &quot;vital Importance of Being Earnest.&quot;</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c2">His two unfinished plays: </span><span class="c5 c6">La Sainte Courtisane</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;and </span><span class="c5 c6">A Florentine Tragedy</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c1">NOVEL:</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c5 c6">The Picture of Dorian Gray</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;a philosophical fiction and gothic horror novel, first published as a novella in </span><span class="c2 c6">Lippincott&#39;s Monthly Magazine</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;(1890), then revised into a full novel in 1891. Wilde&rsquo;s only novel, it faced criticism for its themes of immorality but later became a classic of Gothic literature. &nbsp;In response to criticism, Wilde wrote a famous preface (1891) defending the autonomy of art, published separately as a literary manifesto. PLOT: In Victorian England, Dorian Gray, influenced by Lord Henry&#39;s hedonism, wishes his portrait ages instead of him. He rejects actress Sibyl Vane after she fails to perform and her suicide follows. Dorian lives a life of indulgence for 18 years, guided by a corrupt French novel. After killing Basil, who discovers the monstrous portrait, Dorian forces scientist Alan Campbell to dispose of the body, leading to Campbell&#39;s suicide. Dorian&#39;s guilt leads him to seek redemption, but he realizes his efforts were driven by vanity. In the end, he stabs his portrait, only for his servants to find his withered corpse while the portrait becomes youthful again.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c1">SHORT FICTION:</span></p><p class="c21"><span class="c5 c3 c6"><a class="c0" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Happy_Prince_and_Other_Tales&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1736319756160135&amp;usg=AOvVaw28coAuL-6gozRuFmWUN-3r">The Happy Prince and Other Tales</a></span><span class="c2 c6">&nbsp;</span><span class="c2">(1888, a collection of fairy tales): 1</span><span class="c2 c17">ST</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;tale innit &quot;The Happy Prince&quot;.

Written in the Decadent style, influenced by French writers like Huysmans, Baudelaire and Rollinat. Initially poorly received, now regarded as Wilde&#39;s finest Decadent work, a quintessential fin-de-si&egrave;cle piece. The poem begins with the narrator describing the Sphinx in his room, calling her &quot;exquisite grotesque&quot; (half woman, half animal). Narrator contrasts her antiquity with his own &quot;twenty summers&quot; and asks about witnessing Classical history and Egyptian mythology. Questions the Sphinx&#39;s lovers, naming various Egyptian animals, mythical beasts, and gods. States Ammon was her lover and details their sexual liaison, Ammon&rsquo;s beauty and the eventual ruin of that splendor. Suggests the Sphinx return to Egypt to find Ammon&rsquo;s remains, but Ammon and her divine lovers are not dead. The Sphinx could resume her passions with gods or beasts in Egypt, but the narrator dismisses her, disgusted by her sensuality and his own desires: &quot;You make my creed a barren sham, you wake foul dreams of sensual life.&quot; Narrator turns to his crucifix, asking to be left with Christ, who &quot;weeps for every soul who dies and weeps for every soul in vain.&quot; &nbsp;Written originally in four-line stanzas (ABBA rhyme scheme), later altered to two 16-syllable lines with internal rhymes.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c5 c3 c6"><a class="c0" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Ballad_of_Reading_Gaol&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1736319756162597&amp;usg=AOvVaw1g7snyrpQfcRw7TEqym8tv">The Ballad of Reading Gaol</a></span><span class="c1">&nbsp;(1898): written in exile in Berneval-le-Grand (France) and Naples (Italy) after his release from Reading Gaol on 19 May 1897.

In the resulting confrontation the English are satirised and, in the end, disappointed when a symbolic storm destroys their dream of resettling the old into the present.

Bert, a truck driver, eventually leaves in his &quot;van.&quot; Rose&#39;s attempt to take out the garbage is interrupted by Mr. and Mrs. Sands, who are looking for a flat and Mr. Kidd. Riley, a blind black man who has been waiting in the basement, arrives with a mysterious message from Rose&#39;s &quot;father.&quot; The play ends violently when Bert returns, finds Rose stroking Riley&#39;s face, delivers a sexually suggestive monologue about his van and then beats Riley, possibly to death.

I can&#39;t see.&quot;</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c5 c6">The Birthday Party</span><span class="c5">&nbsp;(1957)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;first full-length play, comedy of menace. </span><span class="c2 c6">The Birthday Party</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;centers on Stanley Webber, a former piano player living in a rundown boarding house run by Meg and Petey Boles in a seaside English town. On what is supposedly Stanley&#39;s birthday, two sinister strangers, Goldberg and McCann, arrive and turn his seemingly ordinary birthday party into a nightmare. </span><span class="c5">Act 1 </span><span class="c2">Meg prepares breakfast while Stanley, disheveled and suspicious, learns of the arrival of &quot;two gentlemen.&quot; When Goldberg and McCann arrive, Stanley attempts to eavesdrop but hears only vague talk about &quot;the job.&quot; After they leave, Meg gives Stanley a toy drum as his birthday present. </span><span class="c5">Act 2 </span><span class="c2">Stanley&rsquo;s behavior becomes erratic as McCann prevents him from leaving. Goldberg and McCann interrogate Stanley, who denies it is his birthday and questions their motives. Meg arrives in party attire, and the party begins with toasts and games. Stanley, increasingly agitated, attacks Meg and attempts to rape Lulu during a blackout. Goldberg and McCann then corner the maniacal Stanley. </span><span class="c5">Act 3</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;Petey has breakfast and expresses concern about Stanley&rsquo;s condition to Goldberg, who is preparing to take Stanley to an unseen character, Monty. Goldberg briefly loses his confidence but recovers. Lulu confronts Goldberg about events from the previous night and is driven away by McCann. Stanley is brought in, broken and unable to respond to questions. Goldberg and McCann lead him to a car, with Petey reluctantly allowing Stanley&#39;s departure. Meg returns, unaware of the truth, as Petey remains silent about Stanley&rsquo;s fate.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c5 c6">The Dumb Waiter</span><span class="c5">&nbsp;(1957)</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;one-act play. Two hit-men, Ben and Gus, wait in a basement room for their assignment. Ben reads a newspaper while Gus ties his shoes and tries to make tea, leading to an argument over &quot;light the kettle&quot; versus &quot;put on the kettle.&quot; Food orders come through a dumbwaiter, though the basement isn&#39;t a kitchen. Gus leaves to get water and the dumbwaiter&#39;s speaking tube signals that their victim has arrived. Ben prepares for the target, but Gus returns without his jacket, waistcoat, tie, or gun. The curtain falls as the two men stare at each other in silence.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c5 c6">A Slight Ache</span><span class="c5">&nbsp;(1958)</span><span class="c2">; </span><span class="c5 c6">The Hothouse</span><span class="c5">&nbsp;(1958)</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c5 c6">The Caretaker</span><span class="c5">&nbsp;(1959) </span><span class="c2">three acts a tragicomedy. </span><span class="c5">Act I </span><span class="c5 c6">Scene 1 </span><span class="c2">Aston invites Davies, a homeless man, into his flat after rescuing him from a bar fight. Davies criticizes the cluttered flat and rejects shoes offered by Aston, revealing his real name as Mac Davies, not &quot;Bernard Jenkins&quot;. He plans to retrieve his papers from Sidcup once he finds suitable shoes. They discuss sleeping arrangements and the leaky roof. Davies gets into bed while Aston fiddles with an electrical plug. </span><span class="c5 c6">Scene 2 </span><span class="c2">In the morning, Davies denies making noise during the night, blaming the neighbors and reveals his fear of foreigners. Aston, trusting Davies, leaves the room. Davies starts rummaging through Aston&rsquo;s belongings but is caught by Aston&rsquo;s brother, Mick, who seizes Davies in a choreographed struggle, ending Act One with Mick&rsquo;s question, &quot;What&#39;s the game?&quot; </span><span class="c5">Act II </span><span class="c5 c6">Scene 1 </span><span class="c2">Mick interrogates Davies, calling him &quot;Jenkins&quot; and accusing him of being a robber and &quot;stinking the place out&quot;. Mick&rsquo;s confusing jargon and exaggerated praise of Aston&rsquo;s decorating skills unsettle Davies. Aston enters with a bag for Davies and a comic struggle over it ensues. Davies reveals the bag isn&#39;t his and is offered a caretaker job, but expresses concerns about being found out. </span><span class="c5 c6">Scene 2</span><span class="c2 c6">&nbsp;</span><span class="c2">Davies tries the light switch, only to find Mick has removed the bulb as a prank. Mick discusses taking responsibility for the flat and offers Davies the caretaker job again but is annoyed by Davies&#39; negative remarks about Aston. They discuss a small financial agreement and the need for Davies&rsquo; papers from Sidcup. </span><span class="c5 c6">Scene 3</span><span class="c2 c6">&nbsp;</span><span class="c2">Davies complains to Aston about the flat and its setup. Aston recounts his past mental hospital experience, including electric shock therapy and expresses his wish to build a shed in the garden. This monologue is seen as the play&rsquo;s climax. The plot then transitions to its falling action. </span><span class="c5">Act III </span><span class="c5 c6">Scene 1 </span><span class="c2">Two weeks later, Mick discusses redecorating the flat. Davies criticizes Aston&rsquo;s behavior and tries to ingratiate himself with Mick, betraying Aston. Aston gives Davies another pair of shoes and Davies talks again about going to Sidcup for his papers. </span><span class="c5 c6">Scene 2</span><span class="c2 c6">&nbsp;</span><span class="c2">That night, Davies insults Aston, who asks him to leave. Davies, mistakenly thinking Mick will side with him, leaves angrily. </span><span class="c5 c6">Scene 3</span><span class="c2 c6">&nbsp;</span><span class="c1">Davies returns, complaining about Aston and asking Mick for support. Mick sides with Aston, forces Davies to admit his real name and pays him off. Aston and Mick exchange smiles. Davies, begging to stay, is rebuffed by Aston, who remains unresponsive as Davies pleads, ending the play in silence</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c5 c6">A Night Out</span><span class="c5">&nbsp;(1959)</span><span class="c2">; </span><span class="c5 c6">Night School</span><span class="c5">&nbsp;(1960)</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c5 c6">The Homecoming</span><span class="c5">&nbsp;(1964) </span><span class="c2">two-act play. Set in North London, the play has six characters. Five of these are men of the same family: Max, a retired butcher; his brother Sam, a chauffeur; and Max&#39;s three sons: Teddy, a philosophy professor in the United States; Lenny, a pimp who only makes discreet references to his &quot;occupation&quot; and his clientele and flats in the city (London); and Joey, a brute training to become a professional boxer and who works in demolition. The sixth character is a woman, Ruth, Teddy&#39;s wife. The play concerns Teddy&#39;s and Ruth&#39;s &quot;homecoming,&quot;. After six years in the U.S., Teddy brings his wife, Ruth, to his working-class family in North London for the first time. Ruth finds the environment familiar and more engaging than their academic life in America. </span><span class="c5">Act One:</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;The play begins with a power struggle between Max, the father, and his middle son, Lenny. Max and his sons engage in verbal sparring, with Max feminizing his brother Sam and claiming to have &quot;given birth&quot; to his sons. Teddy and Ruth arrive, revealing they married in London and moved to the U.S. Their mutual discomfort and Ruth&rsquo;s flirtation with Lenny expose marital issues. Ruth, calling Lenny &quot;Leonard,&quot; strikes a nerve. After a charged conversation with Lenny, Ruth exits and Max, discovering Teddy and Ruth&#39;s presence, initially mistakes Ruth for a prostitute but attempts reconciliation when he learns she is his daughter-in-law. </span><span class="c5">Act Two:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;The act starts with the men sharing cigars, symbolizing phallic imagery. Max reminisces about family life and his butcher past but ends abruptly with cynicism. Ruth reveals details about her past and views on America, prompting Teddy to suggest returning home. Ruth&#39;s history as a model comes out during a private conversation with Lenny. Teddy, worried about what Ruth might have revealed, witnesses Lenny&rsquo;s advances on Ruth and Joey&rsquo;s inappropriate behavior. Max proposes keeping Ruth as a prostitute, discussing it with varying degrees of seriousness. Teddy refuses to contribute and hints that Ruth would age quickly. Ruth, understanding the proposal, negotiates terms, including a three-room flat and a maid. Sam collapses after revealing a secret about Jessie and MacGregor. Ruth accepts the proposal and Teddy, frustrated by Sam&rsquo;s condition, decides to leave for the airport alone. In the final scene, Ruth sits relaxed in a chair, almost regal, while Sam lies motionless, Joey rests his head on Ruth&rsquo;s lap and Lenny observes. Max, feeling ignored, asks Ruth to kiss him. Ruth continues to touch Joey&rsquo;s head while Lenny stands by, leaving the play&#39;s resolution ambiguous, in line with Pinter&#39;s dramatic style.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c5 c6">The Basement</span><span class="c5">&nbsp;(1966)</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c5 c6">Old Times </span><span class="c5">(1970) </span><span class="c2">The play was dedicated to Hall to celebrate his 40th birthday</span><span class="c5">. </span><span class="c1">The play begins with married couple Kate and Deeley discussing the arrival of Kate&#39;s old friend Anna. Kate says Anna was her only friend and mentions Anna occasionally stole her underwear. Deeley is surprised to hear they roomed together 20 years ago. When Anna arrives, she reminisces about their youth while Kate says little. Deeley recalls meeting Kate at a movie and asking her out. Anna counters with a story about finding Kate with a crying man in their room. Anna ignored the man, who eventually lay across Kate&#39;s lap before leaving. Kate neither confirms nor denies the story and goes to take a bath. During Kate&#39;s bath, Deeley confronts Anna, claiming they&#39;ve met before. He recounts buying her a drink at a party 20 years ago and looking up her skirt. Anna pretends ignorance, but Deeley insists she mimicked Kate&#39;s mannerisms back then. He recalls first meeting Kate at a movie showing the film Odd Man Out. When Kate returns, Deeley and Anna vie for her attention, but she remains mostly silent. Anna admits to wearing Kate&#39;s underwear to a party. Kate responds to their stories by saying to Anna, &quot;I remember you dead,&quot; and describes finding Anna&#39;s dead body in bed, covering her with dirt and nearly suffocating a man who later proposed to her.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c5 c6">Ashes to Ashes</span><span class="c5">&nbsp;(1996)</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c5 c6">Celebration</span><span class="c5">&nbsp;(1999) </span><span class="c1">The plot revolves around three couples dining at an upscale restaurant. Brothers Lambert and Matt are married to sisters Julie and Prue and they are celebrating Lambert and Julie&#39;s wedding anniversary. At another table are Russell and Suki, who later join the others. The diners&#39; conversations are interspersed with existential reflections from Richard, the restaurateur, Sonia the maitresse d&#39; and a Waiter. What starts as a celebratory meal evolves into a complex web of sinister themes, including love/hate relationships and incest. The play concludes with a cryptic speech from the Waiter, suggesting a possible escape from life&#39;s pains.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c2">Pinter&#39;s</span><span class="c5">&nbsp;&quot;memory plays&quot;</span><span class="c2">.

The play follows Serjeant Musgrave and his three soldiers&mdash;Hurst, Sparky and Attercliffe&mdash;who desert a colonial war and pose as recruiters in a northern English coal mining town in 1879. They arrive during a coal strike, cut off by snow and meet the townspeople, including Mrs. Hitchcock and the barmaid Annie. Musgrave reveals their real mission: to protest the violence of the war and avenge the death of their comrade, Billy Hicks, who was from this town. During their stay, tensions rise as Sparky and Annie plan to run away together, but Sparky is accidentally killed. Musgrave, instead of recruiting, reveals a Gatling gun and the skeleton of Billy Hicks, intending to incite violence in revenge. Annie exposes Sparky&rsquo;s death, and the situation escalates. Hurst is killed by the dragoons and Musgrave and Attercliffe are imprisoned, facing execution. In the final scene, Musgrave and Attercliffe discuss their differing views on life and ideals. &ldquo;This is a realistic, but not a naturalistic play&rdquo; wrote Arden in the novel&rsquo;s introduction.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c5 c6">Live Like Pigs</span><span class="c5">&nbsp;(1958)</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c5 c6">The workhouse donkey: a vulgar melodrama</span><span class="c5">&nbsp;(1964) </span><span class="c1">mocks the corruptions of local government in a gallimaufry of presentational idioms - naturalism, burlesque, verse, song</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c5 c6">Armstrong&#39;s last goodnight</span><span class="c5">&nbsp;(1965), </span><span class="c2">based on the story of Johnnie Armstrong.

(If he sinned, he has been himself). Then Peer breaks through to Solveig, asking her to forgive his sins.

Where was I as the one I should have been, whole and true, with the mark of God on my brow?&quot; She answers: &quot;In my faith, in my hope, in my love.&quot; Presumably, he dies in this last scene of the play &quot;Peer, we shall meet at the last crossroads, and then we shall see if...

The Peter Pan stories also involve the characters&nbsp;Wendy Darling&nbsp;and her two brothers John and Michael, Peter&#39;s fairy&nbsp;Tinker Bell, the&nbsp;Lost Boys, and the pirate&nbsp;Captain Hook.

Hook has been hunted by the crocodile which ate his hand after it fell into the water and now wants to eat the rest of him. The crocodile also swallowed a ticking clock, so Hook is wary of all ticking sounds.&nbsp;Peter attacked by him but saved by &quot;the Neverbird&quot; and Peter sails home. Wendy falling for him but he has &quot;the feelings of a devoted son&quot;. She&rsquo;s captured by Captain Hook&nbsp;who also poisons his meds. He does not believe Tink about the poison which she herself drinks to prove it. She almost dies and Tink tells him she could be saved if children believed in fairies.&nbsp;Peter&nbsp;turns to the audience&nbsp;watching the play and begs those who believe in fairies to clap their hands. In the novel, it is stated Peter speaks to all the children currently asleep and dreaming of the Neverland. He encounters the crocodile, but it is silent so he copies the creature&#39;s tick,&nbsp;steal the keys and frees the Lost Boys. In&nbsp;the climactic battle, kicks Hook into the jaws of the waiting crocodile. Wendy returns home and the lost boys adopted.

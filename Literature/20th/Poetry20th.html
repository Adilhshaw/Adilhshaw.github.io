class="c25"><span>The rejection of Palgrave&rsquo;s </span><span class="c4">Golden Treasury</span><span class="c6">&nbsp;(1864) which had become school book in Britian in 1930s was a rejection of Romanticism.</span></p><h1 class="c36" id="h.u80bgsrgxvtr"><span class="c22 c38 c34 c41">Georgian Poetry</span></h1><p class="c25"><span>T. E. Hulme was a rejector of these. As a founder of imagism along with Pound, he helped get rid of poetry&rsquo;s business with romanticism. His essays were published (often) for the </span><span class="c4">New Age</span><span class="c6">&nbsp;in which he declared war on &ldquo;Weltanschauung&rdquo; of all philosophy since Renaissance. He wanted the precision and discipline of classicism. He produced religious art with geometrical precision and discipline found in classicals. Imagism dictates the removal of every word that doesn&rsquo;t contribute to the presentation. They used verse libre which they imported from symbolism. This was thus a movement that recognised the cerebral nature pof poetry. Hence, Tennyson&rsquo;s elegiac mode was given up for Donne&rsquo;s more intellectual poetry as it asserted that intellectual and emotional should go together in poetry. It was the &ldquo;unified sensibility&rdquo; of metaphysical poets they were after. This was a repudiation of personality in poetry and assertion of objectivity in art Tennyson&rsquo;s poetry wallowed in self pity and so did romanticism. In &ldquo;Tradition and Individual Talent&rdquo; (1917) Eliot claims that poetry is not an &ldquo;expression of personality&rdquo; but an escape from it; it&rsquo;s not &ldquo;turning loose of emotions&rdquo; but an &ldquo;escape from emotions&rdquo;. To him there should be a gulf between the &ldquo;man who suffers and the mind that creates&rdquo;. The essay was hailed as the manifesto of 20th century poetry. The &ldquo;music of ideas&rdquo; as poetry was, it had to be a burning paradox rather than a sublimated gloss of verbalism; the focus wasn&rsquo;t on beauty but on contrasting ideas about the same object. Ambivalence and paradox are the chief &nbsp;leading forces. See Eliot&rsquo;s dissociation of sensibility.</span></p><p class="c25"><span class="c11">Georgian Poets:</span><span class="c6">&nbsp;as the early 20th century poets were called, they experimented with 19th century poetic sensibilities and traditions but didn&rsquo;t create a new (or old) model of poetry. These include poets like Gordon Bottomley, Lascelles Abercrombie, Harold Monroe, Walter de la mare (a fine specimen of it) , Edward Thomas. Another section of poets who were about to walk out of georgics were Wilfred Owen and Isaac Rosenberg but were killed in the war.</span></p><h2 class="c24" id="h.j7pzmg654b15"><span>John Edward &nbsp;Masefield (1878 to 1967)</span><span class="c26">&nbsp;Laureate 1930&ndash;1967, after Tennyson </span></h2><p class="c8"><span>The second longest-serving poet laureate after Tennyson.

For several months he lived as a vagrant, drifting between odd jobs, before he returned to New York City and found work as a barkeeper&#39;s assistant. He lived feely; then the poem &quot;The Piper of Arll&quot; by Duncan Campbell Scott made him serious about poetry. In 1912 he was awarded the annual Edmond de Polignac Prize. In 1921 Masefield gave the British Academy&#39;s Shakespeare Lecture and received an honorary doctorate of literature from the University of Oxford.

Milton was writing a form of </span><span class="c10">syllabic verse</span><span class="c7">. George Saintsbury disagreed with Bridges, and stated that Milton had simply been using standard extra-metrical liberties, but Bridges was able to answer this objection by showing that every single instance in the poem of such a variation from the norm could be explained by his natural definition of elision; this would be extremely unlikely to be the case if the poet had simply been allowing himself extra-metrical variations as described by Saintsbury. Bridges took the very restricted range of Milton&#39;s variations to be a proof of his thesis. Bridges goes on to talk about Recession of Accent and lists six &quot;rules&quot; for accentual verse.

It has precisely the structure of a Petrarchan sonnet in which each component is three-quarters of its original length. The octave of a sonnet becomes a sestet and the sestet a quatrain plus an additional &quot;tail piece&quot;. That is, the first eight lines of a sonnet are translated into the first six lines of a curtal sonnet and the last six lines of a sonnet are translated into the last four and a half lines of a curtal sonnet. Used in 3 poems, viz. &quot;Pied Beauty&quot;, &quot;Peace&quot;, and &quot;Ash Boughs&quot;.

Hopkins saw sprung rhythm as a way to escape the constraints of running rhythm, which he said inevitably pushed poetry written in it to become &quot;same and tame&quot;. It is designed to imitate the rhythm of natural speech. It is constructed from feet in which the first syllable is stressed and may be followed by a variable number of unstressed syllables. Sprung rhythm may be classed as a form of accentual verse, as it is stress-timed, rather than syllable-timed. &ldquo;The Windhover&rdquo; is an example.</span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c5 c3 c12">3. </span><span class="c5 c14 c11 c12">Inscape </span><span class="c5 c3 c12">and</span><span class="c5 c14 c11 c12">&nbsp;Instress </span><span class="c5 c3 c12">and: concepts about individuality and uniqueness taken from the ideas of the medieval philosopher Duns Scotus. Inscape has been rendered variously as: external design, aesthetic conception, intrinsic beauty, the intrinsic form of a thing, a form perceived in nature, the individual self, the expression of the inner core of individuality, the peculiar inner nature of things and persons, expressed in form and gesture, and an essence or identity embodied in a thing. Instress is when human recognizes the inscape of other beings in an act that Hopkins calls </span><span class="c5 c3 c12 c4">instress. </span><span class="c22 c5 c3 c12">It is the apprehension of an object in an intense thrust of energy toward it that enables one to realize specific distinctiveness. Ultimately, the instress of inscape leads one to Christ, for the individual identity of any object is the stamp of divine creation on it. An example is his poem &quot;As kingfishers catch fire&quot;.</span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c22 c5 c3 c12">&quot;The Escorial&quot; (1860), his earliest extant poem written while studying Keats&#39;s poetry.</span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c5 c3 c12 c4">The Habit of Perfection</span><span class="c22 c5 c3 c12">&nbsp;(1866)</span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c5 c14 c11 c12">&quot;The Wreck of the Deutschland&quot;</span><span class="c5 c3 c12">&nbsp;(1875) a maritime disaster in which 157 people died, including five Franciscan nuns who had been leaving Germany due to harsh anti-Catholic laws. A 35-stanza ode uses sprung rhythm and instress. It forms the basis for the Ron Hansen novel </span><span class="c5 c3 c12 c4">Exiles</span><span class="c5 c3 c12">.

The fairy princess Niamh fell in love with Oisin&#39;s poetry and asks him to join her on the faerie island; he goes and lives as one of the Sidhe for a 100 years.

There they find a woman held captive by a demon and he later fights it for a 100 years and saves her. They return to faerie island and Niamh and Oisin slept and dreamt with them for a hundred years.

The sages will appear in fire and take him hence and once he is out of his body he will never again appear in the form of a natural thing.

Original title &ldquo;He Do the Police in Different Voices&rdquo; from Charles Dickens&#39; novel </span><span class="c3 c4">Our Mutual Friend</span><span class="c0">. In his first note to the poem he attributes the title to Jessie Weston&#39;s book on the Grail legend, From Ritual to Romance (1920). &quot;April is the cruellest month&quot;. &quot;The Burial of the Dead&quot;, introduces the diverse themes of disillusionment and despair. The second, &quot;A Game of Chess&quot;, employs alternating narrations in which vignettes of several characters display the fundamental emptiness of their lives. &quot;The Fire Sermon&quot; offers a philosophical meditation in relation to self-denial and sexual dissatisfaction; &quot;Death by Water&quot; is a brief description of a drowned merchant; and &quot;What the Thunder Said&quot; is a culmination of the poem&#39;s previously exposited themes explored through a description of a desert journey. Pound wrote &quot;Sage Homme&quot; (1921) to celebrate the poem&rsquo;s &ldquo;birth&rdquo;: he identified Eliot as the mother of the poem but compared himself to the midwife: &ldquo;These are the poems of Eliot &hellip;/ Ezra performed the Caesarean Operation.&rdquo; It created &quot;a cult of &#39;The Waste Landers&#39;&quot;. I. A. Richards praised Eliot on these points in his 1926 book Principles of Literary Criticism, describing his imagery technique as &quot;a &#39;music of ideas&#39;&quot;.

The speaker says that a voice was always whispering in their ears as they went that &quot;this was all folly&quot;. The magus seems generally unimpressed by the infant, and yet realizes that the Incarnation has changed everything. He asks, &quot;. . . were we led all that way for / Birth or Death?&quot; The birth of the Christ was the death of the world of magic, astrology, and paganism. The speaker, recalling his journey in old age, says that after that birth his world had died, and he had little left to do but wait for his own end. His narrator in this poem is a witness to historical change who seeks to rise above his historical moment, a man who, despite material wealth and prestige, has lost his spiritual bearings. &quot;</span><span class="c14 c11">A Song for Simeon</span><span class="c3">&quot;: retells in a first-person dramatic monologue spoken by Simeon the story of Simeon from the second chapter of the Gospel of Luke, a just and devout Jew who encounters Mary, Joseph and the infant Jesus entering the Temple of Jerusalem. Promised by the Holy Ghost that he would not die until he had seen the Saviour, Simeon sees in the infant Jesus the Messiah promised by the Lord and asks God to permit him to &quot;depart in peace&quot;. The poem&#39;s narrative echoes the text of the Nunc dimittis, a liturgical prayer for Compline from the Gospel passage. There is evidence of anti-Semitism. </span><span class="c14 c11">Other 3</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;poems by Eliot: &quot;Animula&quot;, &quot;Marina&quot;, &quot;Triumphal March&quot; (not pub.

His style became less ironic, and the poems were no longer populated by multiple characters in dialogue. Eliot&#39;s subject matter also became more focused on his spiritual concerns and his Christian faith. Edwin Muir maintained that &quot;&#39;Ash-Wednesday&#39; is one of the most moving poems he [Eliot] has written, and perhaps the most perfect.&quot; Western Christian fast day that marks the beginning of Lent, forty days before Easter.

Opens with narrator recalling a moment in a garden; discussion on time and how the present, not the future or past, really matters to individuals. Memories connect the individual to the past, but the past cannot change. The scene of the poem moves from a garden to the London underground where technology dominates and they are unable to understand the universe or the Logos. &quot;Time and the bell have buried the day.&quot; &nbsp;&quot;Love is itself unmoving,/Only the cause and end of movement,/Timeless, and undesiring.&quot; For this reason, this spiritual experience of &quot;Love&quot; is the form of consciousness that most interests the narrator (presumably more than the creative act of writing poetry). George Orwell disapproved of Burnt Norton and stated that the religious nature of the poem coincided with Eliot&#39;s poems no longer having what made his earlier works great.</span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c3">2)</span><span class="c3 c18">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span><span class="c3">&quot;East Coker&quot; (1940): published in </span><span class="c3 c4">New English Weekly</span><span class="c3">, and in the US in the May 1940 issue of </span><span class="c3 c4">Partisan Review. </span><span class="c0">Discusses time and disorder within nature that is the result of humanity following only science and not the divine.

These are followed by the sonnet sequence &quot;The Quest&quot; and a verse &quot;Epilogue&quot; (&quot;Returning each morning from a timeless world&quot;). The entire book was written in 1940, and indirectly records Auden&#39;s return to the Anglican Communion.</span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c0">&quot;If equal affection cannot be / Let the more loving one be me&quot; (&quot;The More Loving One&quot;).

Ferdinand addresses Miranda in a sonnet, a form traditionally amenable to expressions of love. Preface &quot;The Stage Manager to the Critics&quot; followed by Part I, &quot;Prospero to Ariel&quot;; Part II, &quot;The Supporting Cast, Sotto Voce, spoken by individual characters in the play, each followed by a brief comment on the character of Antonio; and Part III, Caliban to the Audience, spoken by Caliban in a prose style modelled on that of the later work of Henry James. A &quot;Postscript&quot; (&quot;Ariel to Caliban, Echo by the Prompter&quot;) closes the work. The poem is dedicated to Auden&#39;s friends James and Tania Stern. The 3</span><span class="c3 c17">rd</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;section is longer in which Shakespeare is unable to entertain curtain call thus Caliban presented before audience. Also depicts the paradox where the closer to Art you come, the farther from Life you go, and vice versa. ***</span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Under Which Lyre&rdquo; (1947) the Phi Beta Kappa poem for Harvard </span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c14 c11 c4">The Age of Anxiety: A Baroque Eclogue</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;(1947; UK 1948): long poem in 6 parts written mostly in modern Anglo-Saxon alliterative verse, about a man&#39;s quest to find substance and identity in a shifting and increasingly industrialized world. Set in a wartime bar in New York City, Auden uses four characters &ndash; Quant, Malin, Rosetta, and Emble &ndash; to explore and develop his themes.</span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c14 c11 c4">The Enchaf&egrave;d Flood: The Romantic Iconography of the Sea</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;(1950): first separate prose book of 3 lectures (Page-Barbour Lectures at the University of Virginia), title from a line in Act 2, Scene 1 of Shakespeare&#39;s </span><span class="c3 c4">Othello</span><span class="c0">.

Auden&#39;s limestone landscape has been interpreted as an allegory of Mediterranean civilization and of the human body. As a topographical poem (in which he goes back to his native Yorkshire), it describes a landscape and infuses it with meaning. It has been called the </span><span class="c14 c11">&quot;first &hellip; postmodern pastoral</span><span class="c3">.&rdquo; In a letter, Auden wrote of limestone and the poem&#39;s theme that &quot;that rock creates the only human landscape.&quot; The calcium in limestone makes it water-soluble and easily eroded, yet limestone builds up over eons, a stratum at a time, out of organic matter, recalling the stratified history of Mediterranean civilisation. the Mediterranean&#39;s religious tradition and culture are contrasted in &quot;Limestone&quot; with the Protestant and rationalistic &quot;Gothic North&quot;. Opens like this: &ldquo;If it form the one landscape that we, the inconstant ones,/ Are consistently homesick for, this is chiefly/ Because it dissolves in water.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c14 c11 c4">The Shield of Achilles</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;(1952) and the title work of a collection published in 1955. It is Auden&#39;s response to the detailed description, or ekphrasis, of the shield borne by the hero Achilles in Homer&#39;s epic poem the Iliad in rime royale. Depicts making of the shield by the god Hephaestus, and report the scenes that Achilles&#39; mother, the Nereid Thetis, expects to find on the shield and which Hephaestus Auden&#39;s version, does not make. The stanzas with longer lines describe the scenes of a barren and impersonal modern world that Hephaestus creates in Auden&#39;s version. In the second scene, a crowd of ordinary people watch passively as three &quot;pale figures&quot; are dragged towards and tied to posts. In the third scene, a &quot;ragged urchin&quot; throws a stone at a bird; he takes it for granted &quot;that girls are raped, that two boys knife a third,&quot; and &quot;has never heard of any world where promises are kept / Or one could weep because another wept.&quot; In the closing stanza, composed of short lines, Thetis cries out in dismay at what Hephaestus has made for her son, &quot;who would not live long.&quot; Also in it </span><span class="c14 c11">Bucolics,</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;a sequence of poems by W.

The boy dreams of Flynn, recalling his death from &quot;paralysis.&quot; He feels unexpectedly freed rather than mournful, despite Flynn&#39;s significant influence on him.

The boy is captivated by Mangan&#39;s sister, beginning to idealize her romantically and obsess over her. On learning that she cannot attend the Araby bazaar, he promises to bring her a gift. However, when he arrives at the bazaar, it is mostly closed and disappointing. He sees a young woman at a stall, more interested in her conversation than in serving him, shattering his romantic illusions about both the bazaar and Mangan&#39;s sister.

As she sits by her window, she reflects on her difficult life: her deceased mother and brother, her distant remaining brother Harry, and her oppressive father. Her job offers little satisfaction. Eveline dreams of escaping with her sailor lover, Frank, to Buenos Aires. However, the memory of a melody associated with her mother&#39;s death and a promise to care for her home paralyze her at the dock. Despite Frank&#39;s romantic promises, Eveline is unable to leave Dublin. Joyce uses Eveline&#39;s paralysis to illustrate the broader sense of stagnation felt by Dubliners. Critics debate Frank&#39;s intentions and whether the journey to Buenos Aires signifies a genuine escape or exploitation.</span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c1 c0">&quot;Clay&quot; &ndash; Maria, a beloved, middle-aged woman working at a Dublin rescue mission, eagerly heads to Joe&rsquo;s house for a holiday gathering. After a tea with her laundress colleagues, she buys cakes for the Halloween party but accidentally leaves them on the tram, possibly due to her flirtatious interaction with a drunken elderly man. At Joe&rsquo;s home, she joins in a traditional Halloween game where the objects have prophetic meanings. Maria fails to pick the ring, symbolizing marriage, and instead selects a lump of clay and then a prayer book, suggesting a life devoted to spiritual service. After some wine, Maria sings &ldquo;I Dreamt That I Dwelt in Marble Halls&rdquo; but makes a mistake by repeating the first verse and omitting the second, which yearns for romantic suitors she has never had. The evening ends with Joe, moved by Maria&rsquo;s song, asking his wife for the corkscrew.</span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c1 c0">&quot;The Dead&quot; &ndash; described by T. S.

Gabriel arrives late and has an awkward encounter with Lily, the caretaker&rsquo;s daughter, and is concerned about his speech, which he fears is too academic. He also faces criticism from Miss Ivors, an Irish nationalist, for writing for a Unionist newspaper, which leaves him unsettled. During dinner, Gabriel reflects on the snow outside and delivers his speech, praising Irish hospitality. As the party ends, Gabriel and Gretta leave for a hotel, but Gabriel&#39;s romantic expectations are dashed when Gretta shows little interest. She reveals that the song &quot;The Lass of Aughrim&quot; reminds her of Michael Furey, a deceased former lover from Galway, whose death she believes was caused by his visit to her while sick. Gabriel is stunned by this revelation and contemplates the impact of the dead on the living. The story concludes with Gabriel reflecting on the snow and the inevitability of death, feeling a profound connection to all living and dead as the snow falls.</span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c4 c3">A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;(1916)</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;first novel.&nbsp; Stephen Dedalus rebels against the Catholic and Irish conventions.

The novel serialised in the English literary magazine </span><span class="c0 c3">The Egoist</span><span class="c1 c0">&nbsp;in 1914 and 1915 by Pound. Epigraph, Ovid, &quot;And he turned his mind to unknown arts.&quot; The novel opens with young Stephen Dedalus listening to his father&#39;s fairy tale. His early memories are a mix of sensory experiences - from a candy seller to his mother&#39;s scent and his governess Dante&#39;s brushes. At Clongowes school, Stephen longs for the comfort of study hall while playing outside. He falls ill and spends time in the infirmary, where he learns of Parnell&#39;s death. During winter holidays, he overhears a heated family argument about Parnell and the Catholic Church. Back at school, Stephen is bewildered by sexual incidents involving classmates. He experiences unjust punishment when a teacher beats him for sitting out due to broken glasses. Stephen complains to the rector and gains support from his peers. Years later, Stephen spends a summer in Blackrock with his friend Aubrey, reading &quot;The Count of Monte Cristo&quot; and exploring. Financial troubles force his family to move to Dublin, where he develops a crush on Emma Clery, even writing her a love poem. At Belvedere, Stephen excels academically but faces trouble for his controversial essays. He acts in a school play and takes a melancholy trip to Cork with his father. Despite winning a large sum for academic excellence, Stephen remains restless and begins visiting prostitutes, battling guilt and shame. A religious retreat at school intensifies Stephen&#39;s guilt, leading him to confess and temporarily embrace piety. When offered the possibility of priesthood, Stephen realizes it&#39;s not his calling. Instead, he applies to the University of Dublin and has an epiphany about becoming a writer while observing a girl on the shore. At university, Stephen becomes known for his aesthetic theories, often discussing them with friends, especially Cranly. He continues to think about Emma and writes her another poem. The novel concludes with diary entries detailing Stephen&#39;s excitement about leaving Ireland to pursue his destiny as a writer, showcasing his artistic and intellectual growth throughout the narrative.</span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c4 c3">Exiles</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;(1918) </span><span class="c1 c0">draws on the story of &quot;The Dead&quot;.

The youngest daughter Ethel married a good-for-nothing waiter who died of ulcers the year the little grandson Lennie was born, and the old woman and Ethel had to bring up the sickly boy Lennie who followed his granny about everywhere but who also died of TB eventually.

So &quot;Ma Parker stood, looking up and down. The icy wind blew out her apron into a balloon. And now it began to rain. There was nowhere.&quot; Such a tragic ending to the story produces more pathos than does a picture of a dying woman.</span></li><li class="c8 c6 li-bullet-0"><span class="c1 c0">&quot;Marriage &agrave; la Mode&quot;</span></li><li class="c8 c6 li-bullet-0"><span class="c1 c0">&quot;The Voyage&quot;</span></li><li class="c8 c6 li-bullet-0"><span class="c1 c0">&quot;Miss Brill&quot;</span></li><li class="c8 c6 li-bullet-0"><span class="c1 c0">&quot;Her First Ball&quot;</span></li><li class="c8 c6 li-bullet-0"><span class="c1 c0">&quot;The Singing Lesson&quot;</span></li><li class="c8 c6 li-bullet-0"><span class="c1 c0">&quot;The Stranger&quot;</span></li><li class="c8 c6 li-bullet-0"><span class="c1 c0">&quot;Bank Holiday&quot;</span></li><li class="c8 c6 li-bullet-0"><span class="c1 c0">&quot;An Ideal Family&quot;</span></li><li class="c8 c6 li-bullet-0"><span class="c1 c0">&quot;The Lady&#39;s Maid&quot;</span></li></ol><p class="c8 c18"><span class="c1 c0"></span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c4 c3">The Doves&#39; Nest and Other Stories</span><span class="c1 c0">&nbsp;(1923): collection of short stories published by her husband John Middleton Murry after her death.</span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c1 c0">&quot;The Doll&#39;s House&quot; (1922) (set in New Zealand): The story is set in late 1800s New Zealand and follows the Burnell family, particularly the three Burnell sisters: Isabel, Lottie, and Kezia. They receive a beautiful doll&rsquo;s house as a gift, which becomes the center of attention among their schoolmates. Isabel, the eldest, takes charge of showing the doll&rsquo;s house to her friends, but she excludes the Kelvey sisters, Lil and Else, who are from a lower social class and are often ostracized by the other children. Despite the social barriers, Kezia, the youngest Burnell sister, feels a sense of compassion and invites the Kelvey sisters to see the doll&rsquo;s house. This act of kindness is met with disapproval from her family, highlighting the rigid class distinctions and prejudices of the time.

The apparent theme is again a rich and happy woman&#39;s inherent jealousy, but actually the author is asking a more fundamental question about the heroine&#39;s idea of happiness in spite of her outward life of luxury and ease</span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c1 c0">&quot;Taking the Veil&quot; (1923)</span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c1 c0">&quot;The Fly&quot; (1922)</span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c1 c0">&quot;The Canary&quot; (1923): The story is told in the first person by a lonely woman.

His wife, Mrs. Potts, frequently complains of mysterious pains and calls out a former lover&#39;s name, which Mr. Potts interprets as a sign of her recovery. He continues to care for her without resentment. The story contrasts Mr. Potts&#39; modest appearance with his inner strength and resilience, highlighting the tendency to judge based on looks rather than character.</span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c1 c0">&quot;Such a Sweet Old Lady&quot;</span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c1 c0">&quot;Second Violin&quot; (set in London)</span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c1 c0">&quot;Weak Heart&quot; (set in New Zealand)</span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c1 c0">&quot;Widowed&quot; (set in London)</span></p><h1 class="c17"><span class="c4">David Herbert Lawrence (1885-1930) </span><span class="c0 c13">(Taken from Azra&rsquo;s notes 20</span><span class="c10 c0">th</span><span class="c12 c0">&nbsp;Century Early novel)</span></h1><p class="c8"><span class="c1 c0">English novelist, short story writer</span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c1 c0">He described his voluntary exile as a &quot;savage enough pilgrimage&quot;.</span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c0">His first published work was a group of his early poems in the &quot;English Review&quot; in 1909, and in 1910 appeared his early short story and then his first novel &quot;</span><span class="c4">The White Peacock</span><span class="c1 c0">&quot;.</span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c0">It was in 1910 that he broke his engagement with Jessie Chambers (identified generally with Mir-jam in &quot;Sons and Lovers&quot;), became engaged to Louis Burrows, witnessed his mother&#39;s death and began the first version of </span><span class="c4">&quot;Sons and Lovers&quot;</span><span class="c1 c0">, which was published in 1913.</span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c0">1912 Lawrence wrote the first of his so-called &quot;mining plays&quot;, </span><span class="c4">The Daughter-in-Law</span><span class="c1 c0">, written in Nottingham dialect.</span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c0">He showed his indebtedness to Freud in his works written in reply to the Austrian physician and psychopathologist: </span><span class="c4">&quot;Psychoanalysis and the Unconscious&quot; (1921)</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;and </span><span class="c4">&quot;Fantasia of the Unconscious&quot; (1922)</span><span class="c1 c0">.</span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c0">He made his defense of &quot;Lady Chatterley&#39;s Lover&quot; first in </span><span class="c4">&quot;&Agrave; Propos of Lady Chatterley&#39;s Lover&quot;</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;(at first entitled &quot;My Skirmish with Jolly Roger&quot;) and then in a pamphlet </span><span class="c4">&quot;Pornography and Obscenity&quot; (1929).</span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c0">Two notebooks of Lawrence&#39;s unprinted verse were posthumously published as</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;</span><span class="c4 c3">Last Poems</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;</span><span class="c0">and </span><span class="c4 c3">More Pansies</span><span class="c0">.

The couple fights and drifts apart, with Walter retreating to the pub after work each day. Gradually, Mrs. Morel&#39;s affections shift to her sons, starting with the eldest, William. As a boy, William is so attached to his mother that he does not enjoy the fair without her. As he grows older, he defends her against his father&#39;s occasional violence. Eventually, he leaves their Nottinghamshire home for a job in London, where he begins to rise into the middle class. He becomes engaged but detests his fianc&eacute;e&#39;s superficiality.

At Miriam&#39;s family&#39;s farm, Paul meets Clara Dawes, a young woman with feminist sympathies who is separated from her husband, Baxter. After pressuring Miriam into a physical relationship, which he finds unsatisfying, Paul breaks with her and grows more intimate with Clara, who is more passionate physically.

Was banned in the UK for 11 years. Follows three generations of the Brangwen family, farmers and craftsmen in the east Midlands of England, from the 1840s to 1905. The story begins with Tom Brangwen, a farmer who marries Lydia, a Polish refugee. It then shifts to Lydia&#39;s daughter, Anna, and her turbulent relationship with her husband, Will. The final and most prominent part of the book focuses on Ursula, Anna and Will&#39;s daughter, who struggles to find fulfillment in an increasingly industrialized and materialistic society. Ursula experiences a same-sex relationship and a passionate, ultimately doomed affair with Anton Skrebensky, a British soldier of Polish descent. The book concludes with Ursula envisioning a rainbow as a symbol of a hopeful future for humanity.</span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c4 c3">Women in Love</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;(1920) </span><span class="c1 c0">follows the Brangwen sisters, Gudrun and Ursula. Gudrun, an artist, has a destructive relationship with industrialist Gerald Crich, while Ursula develops a love for Rupert Birkin. Their relationships are marked by societal and personal conflicts. At a party, Gerald&#39;s sister drowns, and his father dies soon after. During a holiday in the Austrian Alps, Gudrun befriends artist Loerke, which angers Gerald. In a fit of rage, Gerald attempts to strangle Gudrun, then retreats to the mountains, where he dies from exposure. Birkin is deeply affected by Gerald&#39;s death, reflecting on their lost friendship and his commitment to Ursula. The novel explores British society before World War I and ends in the Tyrolean Alps. Ursula is inspired by Lawrence&#39;s wife, Frieda, Gudrun by Katherine Mansfield, Birkin by Lawrence, and Crich by Mansfield&#39;s husband, John Middleton Murry. The book stirred criticism for its portrayal of love, and denounced as chauvinistic and centred upon the phallus by the philosopher Simone de Beauvoir in The Second Sex.</span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c4 c3">The Lost Girl</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;(1920) </span><span class="c1 c0">Alvina Houghton, the daughter of a widowed Midlands draper, comes of age just as her father&rsquo;s business is failing.

The title refers to the rod of Aaron in the Old Testament, Moses&#39; brother who built the Golden Calf in the desert for the worship of the Israelites. The rod, his divine symbol of authority and independence, finds its echo in the flute of Aaron Sisson. British writer, Reginald Turner, was the model for the character &quot;little Algy Constable&quot; in Aaron&#39;s Rod.&nbsp; John Middleton Murry praised the novel in his periodical &quot;Nation and Athenaeum&quot;:</span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c1 c0">&quot;To read &#39;Aaron&#39;s Rod&#39; is to drink of a fountain of life.... &#39;Aaron&#39;s Rod&#39; is the most important thing that has happened to English literature since the war.

He befriends Rawdon Lilly, a Lawrence-like writer, who helps him recover from an illness in London. In Florence, Aaron joins intellectual circles, engages in political debates, and has an affair with an aristocratic lady. The novel ends with an anarchist or fascist explosion destroying Aaron&#39;s flute, symbolizing his lost potential.</span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c4 c3">Kangaroo</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;(1923) </span><span class="c1 c0">is a &lsquo;strongly auto-biographical&rsquo; novel set in Australia and follows Richard Lovat Somers, an English writer, and his German wife, Harriet, who travel to New South Wales in the early 1920s. The novel explores Richard&rsquo;s engagement with two political movements: the right-wing Digger movement led by Benjamin Cooley (nicknamed &ldquo;Kangaroo&rdquo;) and the socialist movement led by Willie Struthers. Initially intrigued, Richard rejects both due to their extreme ideologies. The novel, written during Lawrence&#39;s stay in Thirroul, features vivid Australian landscapes and reflects on Richard and Harriet&rsquo;s complex marriage, along with Lawrence&rsquo;s disillusionment with fringe politics and his desire to distance himself from humanity&rsquo;s entanglements. It was written in six and a half weeks during Lawrence and his wife Frieda&rsquo;s eleven week stay in the NSW coastal town of Thirroul in 1922.

SUMMARY: After Easter, Irish tourist Kate Leslie and her American cousin Owen Rhys visit Mexico, where Kate is initially excited by a bullfight but leaves in disgust after witnessing the violence. She meets Mexican General Don Cipriano and later encounters political discussions about the Mexican Revolution. Kate also reads about a religious movement in Sayula led by Ram&oacute;n Carrasco, who aspires to replace Christian worship with that of Aztec gods. Kate decides to stay in Mexico and explores the Men of Quetzalcoatl, founded by Ram&oacute;n. Despite initially being wary of his plans to replace Christian symbols with Aztec ones, Kate begins to sympathize with Ram&oacute;n. Cipriano proposes marriage to Kate, suggesting she become a goddess alongside him and Ram&oacute;n. The new president&rsquo;s unpopular policies lead to rebellion and church opposition against Ram&oacute;n. Ram&oacute;n and Cipriano attempt to remove Christian imagery from churches, leading to further unrest. Kate becomes involved in the conflict, supports Ram&oacute;n&#39;s movement, and marries Cipriano, adopting the name &quot;Malintzi.&quot; The novel concludes with Mexico in religious turmoil, the Catholic Church outlawed, and Quetzalcoatl worship declared the official religion. Kate remains conflicted about her future in Mexico</span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c4 c3">Lady Chatterley&#39;s Lover</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;(1928) </span><span class="c0">last novel.

Hilda forces Clifford to hire a nurse, Ivy Bolton, easing Constance&#39;s burden. Constance and Mellors&#39; relationship deepens, with her considering having his child.

Their affair becomes entangled with Hepburn&#39;s wife Evangeline, who suspects infidelity. The narrative features two parallel threads: a symbolic tale centered on &quot;The Captain&#39;s Doll,&quot; representing the dehumanizing effects of war on Hepburn, and a traditional story about the characters. The doll, mirroring Hepburn&#39;s dehumanization, and a metaphorical glacier symbolize his desire to dominate Hannele. The couple&#39;s ascent of the glacier highlights Hepburn&#39;s megalomania and his projection of his desires onto the natural world.</span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c4 c3">The Ladybird</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;(1923) </span><span class="c0">novella.

Ford defined the trilogy as &#39;nothing more than a tour de force, a fake more or less genuine in inspiration and workmanship, but none the less a fake&#39;. Joseph Conrad described it as &quot;the swansong of the historical romance&quot;</span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c1 c0">PLOT SUMMARY OF TRILOGY: The Fifth Queen trilogy features an omniscient narrator. Katharine Howard, a devout, impoverished young noblewoman, is introduced alongside her fiery cousin, Thomas Culpeper. By chance, she catches the attention of King Henry VIII. With help from her old Latin tutor and spy for Thomas Cromwell, Nicholas Udal, she becomes a lady-in-waiting for Lady Mary. In Henry VIII&#39;s court, Katharine navigates a web of calculating and spying members, rising in prominence. She becomes involved with the King and is used by Cromwell, Bishop Gardiner, Thomas Cranmer, and Nicholas Throckmorton. Her association with Throckmorton, suspected of complicity in Wyatt&#39;s Rebellion, briefly implicates her in January 1554. Katharine&#39;s forthrightness, devotion to the Old Faith, learning, youth, and beauty attract the King, contrasting with historical views of her as flighty and flirtatious.</span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c4">First Novel:</span><span class="c1 c0">&nbsp;Katharine Howard, a devout young Catholic noblewoman in her mid-teens, arrives in London with her cousin, Thomas Culpepper. Henry VIII is disappointed with his new wife, Anne of Cleves, and takes notice of Katharine&#39;s forthrightness and devotion to the Catholic Church. Despite her past with Culpepper, she gains favor at court. The novel portrays the chaos in England with Catholics and Protestants clashing, and Thomas Cromwell plotting behind the scenes. Katharine gradually gains acceptance in court amid the political and religious turmoil.</span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c4">Second Novel</span><span class="c1 c0">: Focuses on Thomas Cromwell&#39;s plotting to derail Katharine Howard&rsquo;s rise at court. Cromwell is aware of Henry&#39;s dissatisfaction with Anne of Cleves and aims to prevent Katharine, a Catholic, from becoming queen. Despite his efforts, Katharine wins Henry&rsquo;s heart through her goodness and innocence, not guile. The novel highlights the political machinations and espionage within Henry&#39;s court.</span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c4">Third Novel:</span><span class="c1 c0">&nbsp;Chronicles the plot to remove Katharine Howard, now queen, orchestrated by Thomas Cranmer after Cromwell&rsquo;s execution. Katharine&rsquo;s saintly character and attempts to reconcile Lady Mary with her family contrast with historical accounts. Her kindness and innocence make her less interesting and historically inaccurate. The struggle between Catholicism and Protestantism continues, with even her Catholic supporters turning against her. The novel culminates in Katharine&rsquo;s tragic downfall, painting her as an overly idealized figure.</span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c4 c3">Ladies Whose Bright Eyes</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;(1911) </span><span class="c0">initially published under &quot;Ford Madox Hueffer&quot; and later as &quot;Ford Madox Ford.&quot; The novel was inspired by Mark Twain&rsquo;s </span><span class="c0 c3">A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur&rsquo;s Court</span><span class="c1 c0">&nbsp;and reflects Ford&rsquo;s personal circumstances, including his attempt to divorce his wife, Elsie Martindale Hueffer, to marry Violet Hunt. Mr. Sorrell, a modern man, is transported to the Middle Ages. Unlike Twain&#39;s Hank Morgan, Sorrell makes only a half-hearted effort to introduce modern technology like guns or printing. His attempts fail due to his lack of practical knowledge. Instead, his golden cross causes him to be mistaken for a Greek miracle-worker, granting him hospitality and romantic attention from medieval women. Sorrell&#39;s presence inspires medieval ladies to engage in tournaments, and he himself tries to become a knight. The novel contrasts the romanticized medieval past with its more mundane and power-driven aspects, depicting cathedrals as crowded and commercial rather than serene. Just as Sorrell adapts to his medieval life, he is abruptly returned to the twentieth century, having gained insight and wisdom from his historical experience.</span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c4 c3">The Good Soldier: A Tale of Passion</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;(1915) </span><span class="c0">set before World War I. It tells the tragic story of Edward Ashburnham and his seemingly perfect marriage, using flashbacks and a non-chronological narrative. The unreliable narrator reveals a different reality than expected. Loosely based on Ford&#39;s own experiences with adultery, the novel&#39;s original title was </span><span class="c4">The Saddest Story</span><span class="c1 c0">, changed to The Good Soldier during World War I. Narrated by John Dowell, follows the dissolving relationships of two couples: John and Florence Dowell, and Edward and Leonora Ashburnham. The novel begins with the line: &quot;This is the saddest story I have ever heard.&quot; For nine years, the couples maintain a facade of friendship while seeking treatment for heart ailments at a spa. Florence&rsquo;s ailment is a pretense to avoid intimacy with John, allowing her to have an affair with an artist named Jimmy. Edward&#39;s marriage to Leonora is marred by his infidelities and her control over their finances. Florence commits suicide upon realizing Edward&rsquo;s growing affection for their ward, Nancy, and that John has discovered her affair. Edward, tormented by his love for Nancy and unable to maintain chastity, sends her to India. Leonora sabotages Edward&#39;s last hope by revealing his sordid past to Nancy, who then becomes catatonic upon learning of his death. The novel ends with Dowell caring for Nancy in Edward&#39;s estate, lamenting that no one got what they wanted. He sympathizes with Edward, seeing himself as a disengaged voyeur who failed to participate in life.</span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c0">In the </span><span class="c4">&quot;Dedicatory Letter to Stella Ford&quot;</span><span class="c1 c0">&nbsp;that prefaces the novel, Ford reports that a friend pronounced The Good Soldier &quot;the finest French novel in the English language!&quot;</span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c4 c3">Zeppelin Nights, with Violet Hunt</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;(1915).</span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c4 c3">The Marsden Case</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;(1923).</span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c4 c3">Women and Men</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;(1923).</span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c4 c3">Mr Bosphorous</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;(1923).</span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c0">His tetralogy, </span><span class="c4 c3">Parade&#39;s End</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;(1924 to 1928) </span><span class="c0">includes</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;</span><span class="c4 c3">Some Do Not</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;(1924)</span><span class="c0">, </span><span class="c4 c3">No More Parades</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;(1925)</span><span class="c0">,</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;</span><span class="c4 c3">A Man Could Stand Up</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;(1926)</span><span class="c0">, and </span><span class="c4 c3">Last Post</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;(1928). </span><span class="c0">The novels chronicle the life of Christopher </span><span class="c4">Tietjens</span><span class="c0">, &quot;the last Tory&quot;, a brilliant government statistician from a wealthy landowning family who serves in the British Army during the First World War.

Set in the Bohemianism milieu of pre-war Paris, it presents two artists, the Englishman Tarr and the German Kreisler, and their struggles with money, women and various art and social situations. Tarr, possibly based on the author Lewis, criticizes fellow artists and mistreats his German not-quite-fianc&eacute;e Bertha, to whom he is cruel and deceitful. Kreisler, even worse, is an untalented artist who refuses to return to Germany, sponges money from others, and behaves atrociously at social events. After receiving an ultimatum from his father to return home, Kreisler meets Tarr, who attempts to befriend him. However, Kreisler rebuffs Tarr and ultimately victimizes Bertha, already mistreated by Tarr, leading to a tragic conclusion.</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c4 c3">The Childermass</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;(1928) </span><span class="c0">first of</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;</span><span class="c0">intended tetralogy, </span><span class="c4">The Human Age</span><span class="c0">, of which two more volumes appeared long afterwards in </span><span class="c4">1955</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;- </span><span class="c4">Monstre Gai</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;and </span><span class="c4">Malign Fiesta.</span><span class="c1 c0">&nbsp;The trilogy is set in a fantastic region beyond the grave.

It follows the simpleton Dan Boleyn as he navigates the art world under the misguided guidance of Horace Zagreus, an infatuated sixty-year-old albino who mistakenly believes Dan is a genius. The &quot;Apes of God&quot; are superficial imitators of true creators, characterized as prosperous frauds. Zagreus himself is merely imitating Pierpoint, a painter-turned-philosopher who never appears in the novel but is the source of all societal ideas depicted. The novel&#39;s longest chapter, &#39;Lord Osmund&#39;s Lenten Party,&#39; parodies a fancy-dress party held by the Sitwell-like Finnian Shaw family. The novel&#39;s critique of England builds on Lewis&#39;s ideas from his 1926 book, </span><span class="c0 c3">The Art of Being Ruled</span><span class="c1 c0">.</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c4 c3">Snooty Baronet</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;(1932)</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c4 c3">The Revenge for Love</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;(1937) </span><span class="c0">The novel is set in Spain during the Spanish Civil War and England. Percy Hardcaster, a communist propagandist, is imprisoned in Spain after being caught with dynamite. He plans an escape with help from a guard, but it is foiled, resulting in the guard&#39;s death and Hardcaster&#39;s injury. Later, Hardcaster, now with a wooden leg, is released and returns to England, where Sean O&rsquo;Hara hosts a party in his honor. The party introduces various characters, including the talentless painter Victor Stamp and his wife, Margot, who struggle financially and become targets for shady schemes involving art forgery and political intrigue related to Spain. Jack Druze, an accountant fascinated by the art world, helps artist Tristram Phipps with his finances and becomes infatuated with Tristram&rsquo;s wife, Gillian. Tristram is a naive and struggling artist, also dragged into the forgery plot. The story satirizes talentless artists, political activists, and the bourgeois, with characters like Margot and her friend Agnes showcasing their ignorance and superficiality. The novel, much like </span><span class="c0 c3">The Apes of God</span><span class="c1 c0">, offers brutal satire and a plot intertwined with the murky politics of the Spanish Civil War.</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c4 c3">The Vulgar Streak</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;(1941) </span><span class="c1 c0">Lewis stated that this novel explores ruthlessness and excessive willpower, traits found in Napoleon&rsquo;s and Hitler&rsquo;s armies, and in literary characters like Julien Sorel and Raskolnikov. Vincent Penhale, the protagonist, shares with these characters a desire to escape his lower-class roots. Set in September 1938 during Chamberlain&#39;s negotiations with Hitler, the story begins with Penhale in Venice with his friend Martin Penny-Smythe. They meet April Marrow and her mother, and Penhale gets engaged to April despite Mrs. Marrow&#39;s reluctance due to his mysterious background. Although Penhale appears middle-class, we learn he is actually from a working-class family, having adopted a middle-class accent and manners through effort. He is an actor and dress designer who inherited suspicious money. Throughout the story, his shady past and questionable actions surface. Back in London, Penhale visits his working-class family, except for his sister Madeleine, whom he tries to help ascend socially. The novel highlights the rigid British class system and the challenges of escaping one&#39;s class. Penhale&#39;s deceit and struggle with his true identity are central themes. Critics have mixed views on the novel, which, while more conventional in style, is not considered one of Lewis&#39;s greatest works but is among his most readable.</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c4 c3">Self Condemned</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;(1954); The Red Priest (1956); </span><span class="c4 c3">The Roaring Queen</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;(1973 </span><span class="c0">written 1936 but unpublished); </span><span class="c4 c3">Mrs Duke&#39;s Million</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;(1977</span><span class="c1 c0">; written 1908&ndash;10 but unpublished) &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c4">SHORT STORIES:</span><span class="c1 c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c0 c3">The Wild Body: A Soldier of Humour And Other Stories</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;(1927) The first of the series is &ldquo;A Soldier of Good Humour&rdquo;.The final story is &ldquo;</span><span class="c0 c3">You Broke My Dream&rdquo;</span><span class="c1 c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c0 c3">Rotting Hill</span><span class="c1 c0">&nbsp;(1951) &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c0 c3">Unlucky for Pringle</span><span class="c1 c0">&nbsp;(1973) (short stories)</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c4">AUTOBIOGRAPHIES</span><span class="c1 c0">:</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c0 c3">Blasting and Bombardiering</span><span class="c1 c0">&nbsp;(1937) sheds light on his involvement with Eliot, Joyce, Pound, Ford, Hulme, and T.

For the British police who supervise his execution, the hanging is an unpleasant but routine piece of business. The narrator takes no active part in the hanging, and appears to be less experienced than his colleagues.

All the organs of his body were working&mdash;bowels digesting food, skin renewing itself, nails growing, tissues forming&mdash;all toiling away in solemn foolery. His nails would still be growing when he stood on the drop, when he was falling through the air with a tenth of a second to live. His eyes saw the yellow gravel and the grey walls, and his brain still remembered, foresaw, reasoned&mdash;even about puddles.

The story critiques the impact of commercialism and capitalism on rural England and reflects on the futility of trying to reclaim the past. Bowling, who is nostalgic for his youth, takes a day off work to collect new dentures and is reminded of his childhood through fleeting memories triggered by a news poster and other stimuli. With a bit of extra money from a horse race win, he decides to revisit his old home. However, he finds Lower Binfield transformed beyond recognition, with his childhood haunts replaced by commercial developments. His old home is now a tea shop, and his former girlfriend is almost unrecognizable. The once-idyllic pond has become a rubbish dump. Disheartened by the changes and reminded of impending war, Bowling&#39;s journey underscores the theme that you can&#39;t go home again and highlights the harsh reality of progress overtaking the past.</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c4 c3">Animal Farm</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;(1945)</span><span class="c4 c3">&nbsp;</span><span class="c0">Russian Revolution of 1917.

The teaching staff includes Miss Basden and Mr. Burgess. College fellows William Masson and Richard Bumpus, close friends for 30 years, have a background in writing, with Bumpus having buried his sole manuscript years ago.

His: &ldquo;curses&rdquo; gave him a reputation of a magician and he&rsquo;s invited by his school friend Marcus Maudsley to spend the summer at Brandham Hall. He is a mmiddle-class guy in an aristocratic family there. He&rsquo;s turned into a secret &quot;postman&quot; by Marian and delivers her letters to the nearby tenant farmer Ted Burgess.

Marian is about to become engaged to Hugh, Viscount Trimingham, the descendant of the area&#39;s nobility who formerly lived in Brandham Hall. Leo naively believes that Marian&#39;s engagement ought to bring the correspondence between her and Ted to an end.

The trauma that results leads directly to Ted&#39;s suicide and Leo&#39;s nervous collapse.

Mond outlines for John the events that led to the present society and his arguments for a caste system and social control. John rejects Mond&#39;s arguments, and Mond sums up John&#39;s views by claiming that John demands &quot;the right to be unhappy&quot;. John asks if he may go to the islands as well, but Mond refuses, saying he wishes to see what happens to John next.

Obispo repeatedly rapes Virginia; as Stoyte finds it, he intends to shoot Obispo but accidentally kills Pete. Go to Europe and they find the Fifth Earl, now 201 years old living locked in a dungeon with a female housekeeper, whom he beats.

This forces him to teach at a private school in Wales, Llanabba, run by Dr. Fagan, where he finds the other teachers to be failures.

After winning a civil war and losing his father to cannibalistic soldiers, Seth, the Oxford-educated emperor of Azania, aims to modernize his country. He enlists his college friend Basil Seal to head the Ministry of Modernization, with help from Armenian shopkeeper Krikor Yokoumian. Basil integrates into Debra Dowa&#39;s society, mingling with various officials like General Connolly, Viscount Boaz, the Earl of Ngumo, and British diplomat Sir Samson Courteney. The French consul, Monsieur Ballon, suspects British schemes and plots against Seth. Despite rapid modernization efforts, Seth&#39;s launch of a new currency triggers his downfall. Ballon orchestrates a coup during a &quot;Birth Control Parade,&quot; replacing Seth with his senile uncle Achon, who dies soon after coronation.

Tony Last, an English country squire, joins an expedition to the Brazilian jungle after his illusions are shattered. He becomes the prisoner of a maniac in a remote outpost. Waugh incorporated autobiographical elements from his recent desertion by his wife and his travels to South America. Tony lives with his wife, Brenda, and their son, John Andrew, at Hetton Abbey. Tony is content, but Brenda is bored and begins an affair with John Beaver. Brenda spends time in London and convinces Tony to finance a flat. When John Andrew dies in a riding accident, Brenda, initially thinking John Beaver died, reveals her true feelings. She asks Tony for a divorce to marry Beaver, demanding &pound;2,000 a year, which would force Tony to sell Hetton. Devastated, Tony refuses and decides to travel. Tony meets explorer Dr. Messinger and joins an expedition in the Amazon rainforest. Messinger proves incompetent, and the natives abandon them. Messinger is killed seeking help, leaving Tony ill and stranded. He is rescued by Mr. Todd, who forces Tony to read Dickens to him indefinitely. In England, Tony is presumed dead. His cousins inherit Hetton Abbey and erect a memorial, while Brenda marries Tony&#39;s friend.

He is posted to Cairo and becomes involved in the chaotic evacuation of Crete, where he meets Corporal-Major Ludovic.

Guy is chosen for parachute training, commanded by the paranoid Ludovic, who fears exposure for past crimes. Injured during training, Guy contacts Jumbo Trotter and returns to live with his Uncle Peregrine. Now financially secure after his father&#39;s death, Guy remarries Virginia. Virginia, living with Uncle Peregrine, gives birth to Trimmer&#39;s son, Gervase. Guy is posted to Yugoslavia, where he is disillusioned by the Partisans and learns of his friend&#39;s Communist loyalties. While Guy is abroad, a German doodlebug kills Peregrine and Virginia, but spares Gervase. Guy attempts acts of salvation in Yugoslavia, which backfire.

Without a ticket, he follows Cholmondeley onto a train heading to Nottwich. On the train, Raven encounters Anne Crowder, a chorus girl traveling to start work in a pantomime. Her fianc&eacute;, Mather, is the detective leading the search for Raven. At Nottwich, Raven uses Anne&rsquo;s ticket to disembark and, recognizing him, Anne is taken to an empty house where Raven plans to kill her. However, Anne escapes and chooses not to report the incident out of sympathy for Raven, instead going to the theatre to start her job. At the theatre, Anne is courted by Davis, who is revealed to be Cholmondeley. After dinner, Davis takes Anne to a house and, realizing she knows too much, smothers her, though he does not kill her. The house owner steals Anne&#39;s handbag, which Raven later finds her with when he breaks into the house. Anne, weakened but alive, agrees to cooperate with Raven to get revenge on Davis/Cholmondeley. While in hiding, Raven and Anne discuss Raven&#39;s past, including his mother&rsquo;s suicide, providing context for his actions and foreshadowing his own end.

Kite&#39;s murder, caused by a report from Charles &quot;Fred&quot; Hale in the Daily Messenger, leads Hale to Brighton to distribute cards for a newspaper competition. Realizing Pinkie&#39;s mob is hunting him, Hale meets Ida Arnold by chance in a pub and on the Palace Pier but is snatched away without her noticing. To confuse the police, Pinkie has Spicer distribute Hale&#39;s cards and tries to retrieve one from the caf&eacute; where sixteen-year-old Rose works. Since Rose saw Spicer, Pinkie courts her to marry her and prevent her from testifying against him, though he despises her. In London, Ida reads about Hale&#39;s death, deemed heart failure, and goes to Brighton to investigate, recruiting help and financing her trip with a lucky bet.

During the period when Catholicism was outlawed in Mexico, Tabasco enforced the ban rigorously, while many other states followed a don&#39;t-ask-don&#39;t-tell policy. In Tabasco, priests were forced to renounce their faith, marry, and receive pensions, or face execution if they refused. The story follows a fugitive priest who returns to his former parish town after years and tries to minister to the marginalized people despite many challenges, including prohibition hindering the Mass. The priest, a &quot;whisky priest&quot; with personal failings, meets his daughter but feels no repentance, only a deep love and a desire to save her from damnation. His main antagonist is a morally strict police lieutenant who takes hostages and shoots them if the priest is sheltered. The lieutenant&#39;s pursuit is partly fueled by bad experiences with the church in his youth. Despite feeling unworthy, the priest remains on the run to serve the poor. To avoid the lieutenant&#39;s wrath, he attempts to flee to a neighboring state. He twice encounters the lieutenant but isn&#39;t recognized. Near death after a perilous journey, he is nursed back to health by Protestant landowners and plans to reach the local capital. The priest meets a mestizo, a Judas figure, who lures him to hear the confession of a dying man over the border, suspecting a trap but feeling duty-bound. He is captured by the lieutenant, who, despite admiring him, insists on his execution. On the eve of the execution, the lieutenant tries to enlist the renegade Padre Jos&eacute; to hear the priest&#39;s confession, but Jos&eacute;&#39;s wife thwarts the effort. The lieutenant believes he has eradicated all priests, but in the final chapter, a new covert priest arrives. A faithful Catholic woman, previously shown reading pious tracts to her children, agrees to harbor the new priest, adding the protagonist to her repertoire of Christian martyrs.</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c4 c3">The Ministry of Fear</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;(1943)</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c4 c3">The Heart of the Matter</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;(1948) </span><span class="c1 c0">The book&#39;s title appears halfway through the novel: &quot;If one knew, he wondered, the facts, would one have to feel pity even for the planets?

Meanwhile, a new inspector, Wilson, arrives. He and Louise form a friendship, which Wilson mistakes for love. Scobie inspects local ships for smuggled diamonds. On a Portuguese ship, he finds a letter addressed to Germany, confiscates it, but destroys it after finding it innocuous. Scobie is called to investigate the suicide of Inspector Pemberton, suspecting involvement of a black marketeer named Yusef. Yusef denies it but warns of a new inspector searching for diamonds. Scobie dreams of suicide but dismisses it due to the damnation it would bring. Unable to secure a loan for Louise&#39;s passage to South Africa, Scobie accepts money from Yusef. After a shipwreck, survivors arrive, including Helen Rolt, whom Scobie feels drawn to. They begin an affair, despite his guilt over committing adultery. Yusef blackmails Scobie with a letter to Helen, forcing him to smuggle diamonds. Louise returns, and Scobie struggles to hide the affair. Unable to confess, he commits sacrilege by receiving communion. Yusef&#39;s servant delivers a &quot;gift&quot; to Scobie, which he refuses. Scobie&#39;s servant, Ali, witnesses the affair and the gift. Yusef arranges Ali&#39;s murder, which Scobie blames himself for. Seeing no way out, Scobie fakes a heart ailment, gets sleeping pills, and commits suicide, knowing it means damnation. Helen continues her dreary existence. Louise, realizing Scobie&#39;s death was a suicide, refuses to marry Wilson but remains uncertain. In the final chapter, Louise discusses Scobie&#39;s suicide with a priest, who advises that no one can know what is in a person&#39;s heart or about God&#39;s mercy.</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c4 c3">The Third Man</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;(1949) </span><span class="c1 c0">novella, as a basis for the screenplay.</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c4 c3">The End of the Affair </span><span class="c4">(1951) </span><span class="c1 c0">is the fourth and final of Greene&#39;s &quot;Catholic novels&quot; tetralogy, following Brighton Rock, The Power and the Glory, and The Heart of the Matter.

Jim Dixon is a lecturer in medieval history at a red brick university in the English Midlands. Worried about losing his probationary position, he tries to maintain a good relationship with his absent-minded head of department, Professor Welch. He must also ensure the publication of his first scholarly article, only to find it has been translated into Italian and passed off as someone else&#39;s work. Dixon struggles with his on-again off-again girlfriend, Margaret Peel, who uses emotional blackmail to keep him in a sexless limbo. During a musical weekend at Professor Welch&#39;s, Dixon drunkenly burns a hole in the sheets with a cigarette. Dixon meets Christine Callaghan, the girlfriend of Welch&#39;s son, Bertrand. Despite a bad start, Dixon is attracted to Christine. Bertrand, using Christine to secure a job from her uncle, becomes upset by Dixon&#39;s growing closeness to her. Dixon and Christine kiss and make a date, but decide not to see each other again due to guilt over their respective relationships. During Dixon&#39;s public lecture on &quot;Merrie England,&quot; he drinks too much and mocks the university culture before passing out. Welch informs him that his employment will not be extended, but Christine&#39;s uncle offers him a job in London. Dixon learns from Margaret&#39;s ex-boyfriend that her suicide attempt was faked for emotional blackmail. Freed from Margaret, Dixon meets Christine, who reveals she is leaving Bertrand. They decide to leave for London together, walking off arm in arm and outraging the Welches.</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c4 c3">That Uncertain Feeling </span><span class="c4">(1955)</span><span class="c1 c0">&nbsp;comic novel. A satire on life and culture in a Welsh seaside town, the story concerns a married librarian who begins an affair with the bored wife of a local bigwig. Amis, an English incomer to Swansea in real life, mocks Wales&#39;s devotion to culture and learning as false and pretentious.

Jenny Bunn, 20, moves from Northern England to a town near London to teach primary school. She&#39;s beautiful but holds traditional values, including &quot;no sex before marriage.&quot; She rents a room from Dick and Martha Thompson, sharing the house with Anna, another lodger. Patrick Standish, 30, teaches at a local private school. He quickly asks Jenny out and tries to seduce her on their first date, but Jenny resists.

The story follows Jenny&#39;s new life as a teacher and Patrick&#39;s work and social life, including his friendship with flatmate Graham and the wealthy Julian Ormerod. After a period of dating, Patrick gives Jenny an ultimatum: have sex or end the relationship. Jenny agrees but doesn&#39;t show up. Patrick then sleeps with his headmaster&#39;s schoolgirl daughter. At a party at Julian&#39;s house, Patrick takes advantage of a drunk Jenny. Initially upset, Jenny later accepts what happened. The story ends without a clear &quot;happily ever after.&quot; Years later, Amis wrote a sequel, </span><span class="c4 c3">&quot;Difficulties with Girls,&quot;</span><span class="c1 c0">&nbsp;featuring Patrick and Jenny married but still facing challenges.</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c4 c3">The Anti-Death League (1966) </span><span class="c0">Set in England, it follows the lives of characters working in and around a fictional British Army camp where a secret weapon is being tested.

The novel is set in and around The Green Man, an inn between London and Cambridge owned by 53-year-old Maurice Allington. Maurice lives there with his second wife, teenage daughter, and 80-year-old father. The inn, dating back to the 14th century, is haunted by the ghost of 17th-century owner Thomas Underhill, a Cambridge scholar involved in the occult and linked to two unsolved murders, including his wife&#39;s. Plot: Maurice Allington faces several challenges: his father&#39;s death from a stroke, a drinking problem leading to hallucinations, and an affair with his doctor&#39;s wife. His attempt to seduce his wife and mistress into a m&eacute;nage &agrave; trois backfires when the women become interested in each other. Maurice begins to see ghosts around the inn, including Underhill and his wife, but his family dismisses these as hallucinations caused by stress and drinking. Maurice investigates Underhill&#39;s past at All Saints&#39; College and discovers Underhill&#39;s record of using black arts. Maurice also recalls a drunken conversation with Underhill, who asks for help in his scheme, involving a silver figurine from his grave. Maurice is visited by a young man, revealed to be God, who warns him against Underhill and gives him a silver crucifix as a counter to the figurine. At the midnight meeting, Underhill shows Maurice a terrifying holographic pornography show. Maurice realizes Underhill&#39;s plan to harm his daughter Amy and uses the crucifix to defeat Underhill. In the final scene, Maurice destroys the figurine and exorcises Underhill. His wife leaves him, but he plans a fresh start with his daughter, recognizing his enduring flaws.</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c4 c3">Girl, 20</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;(1971)&nbsp;</span><span class="c1 c0">The novel&#39;s anti-hero is Sir Roy Vandervane, a late middle-aged orchestral conductor and composer. He is a committed philanderer who also has pretensions to be at the vanguard of 1960s counter-culture. The novel is narrated by his friend and colleague Douglas Yandell, whose love life is hardly less complex. Sylvia is Sir Roy&#39;s (much) younger girlfriend with wisdom and guile far beyond her years. The plot describes the interactions of the aforementioned and of wife Kitty and daughter Penny.</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c4 c3">The Alteration</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;(1976)</span><span class="c1 c0">&nbsp;alternate history novel set in a parallel universe in which the Reformation did not take place. It won the John W. Campbell Memorial Award in 1977. The main character, ten-year-old Hubert Anvil, is a chorister at St George&#39;s Basilica, Coverley. His teachers and the Church hierarchy, up to the Pope, decide that his superb voice is too precious to lose to puberty, so Hubert must undergo castration. He tries to escape but is caught. His mother has an affair with the family chaplain, and his brother Anthony is a liberal dissident against repressive church policies. In this alternate history, Arthur Tudor and Catherine of Aragon had a son, Stephen II of England, leading to a papal crusade restoring him to the throne and making Coverley the ecclesiastical capital. The Protestant Reformation didn&#39;t happen; Martin Luther reconciled with the Catholic Church and became Pope Germanian I. Anti-Semitism is rampant, and Jews must wear yellow stars. Thomas More is Pope Hadrian VII, and Protestantism is confined to the Republic of New England. England dominates the British Isles, and the Convocation of clergy rules with the Holy Office&#39;s totalitarian control. The novel opens with the funeral of Stephen III, describing the political and religious figures present, highlighting the alternate historical landscape, including a Christian/Muslim cold war. Pope John XXIV uses the war as a means to control Europe&#39;s population. William Shakespeare&#39;s works are suppressed, while other artists like Mozart and Beethoven submit to religious authority. Hubert&#39;s book collection includes altered versions of famous works, reflecting the clerical domination. Science is banned, with limited technology allowed. Airships connect Europe with other continents, and high-speed trains are used within Europe. The political scene mirrors real 1970s Britain with figures like Lord Stansgate and Officers Paul Foot and Corin Redgrave representing the feared Holy Office. Pope John XXIV resembles Harold Wilson, and his Secretary of State is Enrico Berlinguer. Opera lovers will recognize castrati Federicus Mirabilis and Lupigradus Viaventosa as tributes to singers Fritz Wunderlich and Wolfgang Windgassen.</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c4 c3">Jake&#39;s Thing (1978) </span><span class="c1 c0">is a satirical novel.

Alun Weaver, a writer of modest celebrity, returns to his native Wales with his wife, Rhiannon, sometime girlfriend of Weaver&#39;s old acquaintance Peter Thomas. Alun begins associating with a group of former friends, including Peter, all of whom have continued to live locally while he was away. Drinking daily in the pub with the men, he cuckolds most of them. A poet, Brydan, is a thinly disguised parody of Dylan Thomas. It</span><span class="c0 c3">&nbsp;</span><span class="c1 c0">was considered Amis&#39;s masterpiece by his son, Martin Amis, who wrote, &quot;it stands comparison with any English novel of the century.&quot;</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c4 c3">The Folks That Live on the Hill</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;(1990)</span><span class="c1 c0">&nbsp;The novel&#39;s protagonist Harry Caldecote, a retired librarian, lives in the fictional Shepherd&#39;s Hill area of North London. Harry is twice divorced and lives with his sister Clare. The novel describes the interaction of Harry&#39;s extended family, son Piers, brother Freddie, sister-in-law Desiree and Fiona and Bunty, who are relatives of his former wives, from the viewpoint of the principal characters. Amis lampoons the attitudes and lifestyles of the North London chattering classes.</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c4 c3">The Russian Girl</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;(1992) </span><span class="c1 c0">comedy novel. Set in the early nineties the novel describes in comic detail events set in train by the arrival in London of Russian poet Anna Danilova. Richard Vaisey, Anna&#39;s sponsor and soon-to-be lover is a middle-aged academic, a professor of Slavonic studies not so happily married to wife Cordelia. Anna&#39;s youth and charm is what attracts Richard, not her poetry which he regards as doggerel. Anna attempts to portray her would-be oligarch brother, in legal trouble in Russia, as a dissident in order to elicit support from the London literati. Comedy of course ensues in Cordelia&#39;s response to Richard&#39;s infatuation and in the interaction of the latter with other minor characters.</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c4">His Non Fiction includes:&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c0">1957 </span><span class="c0 c3">Socialism and the Intellectuals</span><span class="c0">, a Fabian Society pamphlet</span><span class="c0 c3">, </span><span class="c0">1965 </span><span class="c0 c3">The James Bond Dossier</span><span class="c0">, 1965 </span><span class="c0 c3">The Book of Bond, or Every Man His Own 007</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;(pseud.

Joe Lampton, a 25-year-old former RAF POW, starts a new job as an accountant in Warley, a Yorkshire market town. Coming from a working-class background in Dufton, he dreams of earning &pound;1,000 a year. Lodging with the affluent Thompsons, he joins a local amateur dramatic society where he meets Susan Brown, a wealthy businessman&#39;s daughter, and Alice Aisgill, an older, unhappily married woman. Joe dates Susan and pursues a sexual relationship with Alice. Despite his aunt&#39;s warning to find a woman of his own class, he continues seeing both women. Joe and Alice&#39;s affair deepens, though they temporarily break up after an argument. Joe reconciles with Alice, but Susan discovers the affair and breaks up with him. Joe and Alice plan to marry after her divorce, but Joe&#39;s friend Charles warns him that it would ruin his career. Persuaded, Joe writes to Susan, reaffirming his love. Susan&#39;s father, learning she is pregnant, offers Joe a job with a &pound;1,000 salary if he marries Susan and breaks with Alice. Joe tells Alice the relationship is over, leading to her tragic death in a car crash. Overwhelmed by guilt, Joe gets drunk and is eventually found by friends. He confesses to feeling responsible for Alice&#39;s death but is assured no one blames him.</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c4 c3">The Vodi</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;(1959)</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;Dick Corvey, suffering from advanced tuberculosis in a provincial sanitarium, reflects on his past, including his friendship with Tom and relationships with women, notably his brief engagement to Lois, who left him when his condition worsened. He often thinks about the Vodi, imaginary creatures invented by Tom that torment the good and harmless. Dick is cared for by Nurse Evelyn Mallaton, whose sympathy and sexual attraction help him fight the disease. Though drawn to Dick, Evelyn gets engaged to a local businessman, seeing no future with Dick. The novel&rsquo;s main theme is the difference between perceived luck and willpower. In the end, Dick leaves the sanitarium, determined to make his way in the world and perhaps win Evelyn back. ( The novelist M. John Harrison names </span><span class="c0 c3">The Vodi</span><span class="c1 c0">&nbsp;as one of his favourite books of all time, defining its genre as &quot;kitchen sink gothic&quot;)</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c4 c3">Life at the Top</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;(1962)</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;It continues the story of the life and difficulties of Joe Lampton.

He now has everything he thought he wanted &ndash; the upper-class wife, an executive job, two cars and two children for his new house. Yet, Joe is still a dissatisfied man; his job had not moved significantly forward in the last 10 years. This dissatisfaction leads him back to his old philandering ways, spurred by the knowledge of his wife&#39;s own infidelity. Joe and Susan separate temporarily, but toward the novel&#39;s close, Joe is drawn back to his life in Warley in response to trouble with his children and his knowledge of what his life needs.</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c0">Other novels include: </span><span class="c0 c3">The Jealous God</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;(1964), </span><span class="c0 c3">The Crying Game</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;(1968), </span><span class="c0 c3">Stay with Me Till Morning</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;(1970) (U.S. title: &quot;</span><span class="c0 c3">The View from Tower Hill&quot;</span><span class="c0">), </span><span class="c0 c3">The Queen of a Distant Country</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;(1972), </span><span class="c0 c3">The Pious Agent</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;(1975), </span><span class="c0 c3">Waiting for Sheila</span><span class="c1 c0">&nbsp;(1976)</span></p><h1 class="c17"><span class="c4">Alan Sillitoe (1928 &ndash; 2010) </span><span class="c0 c13">(Taken from Azra&rsquo;s notes 20</span><span class="c10 c0">th</span><span class="c12 c0">&nbsp;Century 50s and 60s)</span></h1><p class="c5"><span class="c0">English writer</span><span class="c4">. </span><span class="c0">One of the so-called &quot;angry young men&quot; of the 1950s</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c0">He is best known for his debut novel </span><span class="c4 c3">Saturday Night and Sunday Morning</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;and his early short story </span><span class="c4">&quot;The Loneliness of the Long Distance Runner&quot;</span><span class="c1 c0">, which concerns the rebellion of a borstal boy with a talent for running, won the Hawthornden Prize in 1959.</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c0">His autobiography, </span><span class="c4">Life Without Armour (1995)</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c4">Gadfly in Russia</span><span class="c0">, an account of his travels in Russia spanning 40 years, was published in </span><span class="c4">2007</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c1 c0">NOVELS:</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c4">&lsquo;Seaton family trilogy&rsquo;: </span><span class="c0">includes:</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;</span><span class="c4 c3">Saturday Night and Sunday Morning (1958), Key to the Door </span><span class="c4">(1961) </span><span class="c0">and</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;</span><span class="c4 c3">The Open Door</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;(1989)</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c4 c3">Saturday Night and Sunday Morning (1958) </span><span class="c0">won the Author&#39;s Club First Novel Award. is divided into two parts: &quot;Saturday Night,&quot; the larger portion, and &quot;Sunday Morning,&quot; the smaller part. </span><span class="c4">Saturday Night: </span><span class="c0">The story begins in a Nottingham working man&#39;s club where 22-year-old Arthur Seaton is out with Brenda, the wife of his colleague, Jack.

His son, the Prince, doesn&#39;t want to become the God and marry his sister, Pretty Flower. The Prince is going blind, alarming the old blind man. During the run, Great House collides with the blind man&#39;s stick and collapses. The Prince accuses the blind man of lying, and Pretty Flower has him sent to &quot;the pit.&quot; The failure to complete the run is a terrible omen. At a feast, Great House listens to the Liar&#39;s tales of distant places, while Pretty Flower performs a ritual dance to seduce her father, but he is uninterested. This failure requires a &quot;Beginning,&quot; so Great House drinks poison to ensure the river rises and is entombed with his retinue. The river rises, threatening floods. The Prince runs away, finds the pit, and talks to the Liar. The Liar tells him to return at night with jewels and a rope. Head Man, suspecting the rising river is due to Pretty Flower&#39;s attraction to the Liar, discovers she has been having sex with him. The Prince seeks rope, but Head Man plans to force the Liar to join Great House. The Liar proposes marrying Pretty Flower and controlling the river. When soldiers try to kill him, the Liar escapes, killing Head Man, who says the Liar &quot;stings like a scorpion.&quot; The story ends with Pretty Flower suggesting they talk to &quot;Him.&quot;</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c4 c3">&quot;Envoy Extraordinary&quot;</span><span class="c0">&nbsp; first published by as one third of the collection </span><span class="c4 c3">Sometime, Never, alongside </span><span class="c0">&quot;Consider Her Ways&quot; by John Wyndham and &quot;Boy in Darkness&quot; by Mervyn Peake.

He writes an account of a six-month voyage to Australia in the early 19th century by an assorted group of British migrants on a converted man-of-war. It is in the form of a journal written by Edmund Talbot, a young aristocrat. Talbot begins by describing the passengers of all classes (getting a tour of the ship) and crew members, who encompass a motley yet representative collection of early 19th-century English society. He becomes concerned with the downfall of passenger Reverend Colley.&nbsp; Colley dies &ldquo;of shame&rdquo; after getting drunk and performing a sex act on one of the ship&#39;s crew. When one of the crew suggests officers were involved, the captain ends his investigation of Colley&#39;s death, as &quot;buggery&quot; (homosexual intercourse) is punishable by hanging. Talbot comes across Colley&#39;s journal, and feels guilty for seeing how eager Colley was to know him better. Colley is given a formal burial at sea. As the novel closes, Talbot is ambivalent about presenting his own journal to his godfather, as he fears it may not show him in the best light.

The plot revolves around a group of elderly upper-class Britons, centered on </span><span class="c4">Dame Lettie Colston</span><span class="c1 c0">, a retired prison reform committee member. Key characters include her brother Godfrey, a retired brewing company head; his wife Charmian, a successful novelist; and Charmian&#39;s former maid Jean Taylor, now in a nursing home. Dame Lettie starts receiving calls saying, &quot;Remember you must die,&quot; and it turns out the entire group is receiving these calls. Each person describes the caller differently and reacts uniquely: Lettie with paranoia, Godfrey with anger, and Charmian with acceptance. Inspector Mortimer, a retired policeman, investigates but never catches the caller, believed by some to be Death itself. Another plot involves the estate of Lisa Brooke, who had an affair with Godfrey and forced Guy Leet, who has arthritis, to marry her. After Lisa dies, a dispute arises between her secret husband Guy, her siblings, and her housekeeper Mrs. Pettigrew, who has a dubious will in her favor. Mrs. Pettigrew eventually dominates Charmian and blackmails Godfrey. It&rsquo;s revealed that Lisa had married Matthew O&#39;Brien, who is in an asylum, making her marriage to Guy void. When O&#39;Brien dies, the estate passes to Mrs. Pettigrew. Retired sociologist Alec Warner, previously romantically involved with Jean and Lettie, documents the group&#39;s interactions for his gerontology study, but loses his notes in a fire and feels devastated. Alec frequently visits Jean in the nursing home, providing insight into institutional aging. Lettie loses her housekeeper Gwen due to paranoia, disconnects her phone, and is ultimately killed in a home invasion.

The novel draws from both Arthurian legend and Welsh history and mythology, with Myrddin (Merlin) as another major character. The invasion of Wales by the Saxons and the rise of the new religion of Christianity are central themes. It takes place in the time of the mythic King Arthur (499 CE).

A major climax in the novel comes when Porius mates with the young giantess, he names Creiddylad, one of two surviving Cewri, or giants, the true aboriginals of Britain. This is immediately followed by the violent deaths of Creiddyladd and her father.</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c4">Poetry</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c0">In 1905 Powys composed &quot;The Death of God&quot; an epic poem &quot;modelled on the blank verse of Milton, Keats, and Tennyson&quot; </span><span class="c0 c3">Wolf&#39;s Bane</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;(1916), </span><span class="c0 c3">Mandragora </span><span class="c0">(1917) and </span><span class="c0 c3">Samphire </span><span class="c1 c0">(1922)</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c4">Non-fiction</span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c0 c3">Suspended Judgements: Essays on Books and Sensations (1916)</span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c0 c3">Confessions of Two Brothers (1916)&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c0 c3">One Hundred Best Books (1916)</span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c0 c3">The Complex Vision</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;(1920),</span><span class="c0 c3">&nbsp;</span><span class="c1 c0">his first full length work of popular philosophy</span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c0 c3">The Meaning of Culture </span><span class="c1 c0">(1929)</span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span><span class="c0 c3">In Defence of Sensuality </span><span class="c1 c0">(1930)</span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c0 c3">A Philosophy of Solitude</span><span class="c1 c0">&nbsp;(1933)</span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span><span class="c0 c3">Mortal Strife</span><span class="c1 c0">&nbsp;(1942)</span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span><span class="c0 c3">The Art of Growing Old</span><span class="c1 c0">&nbsp;(1944)</span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span><span class="c0 c3">Dostoievsky</span><span class="c1 c0">&nbsp;(1946)</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span><span class="c0 c3">Autobiography</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;(1934): According to J.

Walsh Clifton, an Anglo-Indian, loses his mother during childbirth. Raised in India by his father, John Clifton, and Aunt Brenda, Walsh is torn between his Indian roots and colonial identity. He feels more at ease with Indians, though they are underdeveloped in the novel, and is uneasy around Europeans, especially Christians. Walsh&#39;s sense of superiority over Indians is challenged alongside traditional European masculinity. His awareness of mortality grows, symbolized by an ankle bone in a pyre and his grandmother&#39;s death obsession. Sent to England for education, Walsh grapples with being English or Indian, linked to paternal/masculine and maternal/feminine identities, respectively. This part covers his school experiences, developing sexuality, and his father&#39;s death in India. Walsh has homosexual encounters, significant dreams, and comments on his readings. In the final part, Walsh lives a bohemian life in Soho, earning from his inheritance and composing jazz. He eventually rejects this lifestyle, ending the novel with Ruth, his terminally ill first love, diagnosed by the doctor who delivered him and witnessed his mother&#39;s death.</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c4 c3">Panic Spring</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;(1937)</span><span class="c1 c0">&nbsp;under the pseudonym Charles Norden. Set on the fictional Greek island of Mavrodaphne, named after the black grapes and wine of Patras, the novel features expatriates from Britain and Russia. Each chapter is written from a different character&#39;s perspective. The novel alludes to global political and financial crises, with references to the Berlin Olympics and Greek unrest. PLOT:&nbsp; Marlowe is stranded in Brindisi during Greek political strife and is taken to the island of Mavrodaphne by the boatman Christ, who works for the wealthy businessman Rumanades. Marlowe, a disillusioned schoolteacher, meets Gordon and Walsh from Durrell&#39;s previous novel, &quot;Pied Piper of Lovers.&quot; In the third chapter, Rumanades&#39; history, including his capitalist successes and failed marriage, is narrated, culminating in a fireworks display. Marlowe then moves into one of Rumanades&#39; villas and meets Francis and Fonvisin, becoming interested in Quietism. Subsequent chapters focus on the individual narratives of Walsh, Fonvisin, and Francis. In the tenth chapter, a gramophone concert leads to a cliffside conversation between Francis, Marlowe, and Walsh. Marlowe begins writing on Quietism, and Francis is called back to London but stays for Rumanades&#39; farewell celebration. Rumanades dies of a fever, leading to the departure of the expatriate community due to the ensuing turmoil.</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c4 c3">The Black Book </span><span class="c4">(1938)</span><span class="c1 c0">&nbsp;Lawrence Lucifer, now on a Greek island, reflects on his formative year at the Regina Hotel in England through a disjointed, dreamlike narrative exploring dying English culture. Overwhelmed by details and ideas, Lawrence is unable to act to improve society or himself, using mythic and literary motifs such as birth, death, and crucifixion. His encounters include Tarquin, a writer struggling with his sexual identity; Lobo, a Peruvian cartographer forming relationships with women, including Miss Smith, an African woman Lawrence helps read Chaucer; Chamberlain, who prefers carnal experiences with his wife, Dinah; and Morgan, a Welsh war veteran and hotel custodian. Key figures are an unnamed woman Lawrence addresses often and Herbert &ldquo;Death&rdquo; Gregory, whose diary Lawrence consults. Gregory&rsquo;s story involves his relationship with Grace, a tubercular woman he marries and then resents until her death, after which he seeks a conventional life with Kate, a widowed waitress. Lawrence rejects Gregory&rsquo;s &ldquo;quaint suicide,&rdquo; leaves England, and moves to Greece with his unnamed lover. The novel ends with Lawrence overlooking the Ionian Sea, recording his experiences and waiting for meaning to emerge from his self-exile.</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c4 c3">The Alexandria Quartet</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;(1962) </span><span class="c1 c0">a tetralogy of overlapping novels. The first three books present three perspectives on a single set of events and characters in Alexandria, Egypt, before and during the Second World War. The fourth book is set six years later. The four novels are:</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c4 c3">Justine</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;(1957) </span><span class="c1 c0">is narrated by an impoverished Irish writer and schoolmaster, referred to as &quot;Darley&quot; in later novels. From a remote Greek island, he recounts his time in 1930s Alexandria and his tragic romance with Justine, a beautiful, mysterious Jewish woman married to wealthy Egyptian Copt, Nessim. Alexandria is depicted as an exotic city of cultural and religious interactions, mirroring Justine&#39;s complex character. The narrator and Justine&#39;s secretive affair becomes increasingly desperate and dangerous, with the narrator fearing Nessim may try to kill him. The story alludes to another novel by Justine&#39;s former husband and includes her diary, revealing her many lovers, complex sexuality, and perpetual angst. Two of Constantin Cavafy&#39;s poems, &quot;The City&quot; and &quot;The God Abandons Antony&quot;, translated by Durrell, are included as &quot;workpoints&quot; in the Appendix</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c4 c3">Balthazar</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;(1958)</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;initially titled the book </span><span class="c4 c3">Justine II</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;</span><span class="c0">in his drafts.

Both the epigraphs are from de Sade&#39;s </span><span class="c4 c3">Justine</span><span class="c0">. The book opens with the Narrator on a Greek island with Nessim&#39;s illegitimate daughter from Melissa, now around four or six years old. Unlike the light tone of Durrell&#39;s &quot;Prospero&#39;s Cell,&quot; this narrative is darker.

The novel begins with young David Mountolive&#39;s affair with Leila Hosnani on the Hosnani estate, recalling his maturation and career as a diplomat. Returning to Egypt, Mountolive recontextualizes events from &quot;Justine&quot; and &quot;Balthazar&quot; and retains Pursewarden as his chief political adviser. Mountolive introduces a Coptic gunrunning plot supporting Zionism. Pursewarden kills himself, and Nessim is warned to curb his brother Narouz&#39;s dangerous rhetoric. The novel ends with a wake for Narouz, the Pasha pretending to believe he is implicated to continue receiving bribes from Nessim, and Mountolive preparing to leave Egypt, disillusioned.</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c4 c3">Clea</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;(1960) </span><span class="c1 c0">The book begins with Darley living on a remote Greek island with Nessim&#39;s illegitimate daughter, now six years old, marking the time since &quot;Justine.&quot; Darley has spent this period maturing, thanks to &pound;500 left to him by the writer Pursewarden, who killed himself. Mnemjian arrives with a message from Nessim and news of the Hosnani family&#39;s fall from prosperity. They return to Alexandria, now under nightly bombardment from WWII. Darley reminisces about the past and reconnects with Clea, resuming their romance, now free from the interference of Justine and Melissa.</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c4 c3">The Revolt of Aphrodite</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;(1974)</span><span class="c1 c0">&nbsp;consists of two novels. Genre of dystopic fiction. The two novels are:</span></p><ul class="c15 lst-kix_list_22-0 start"><li class="c8 c6 li-bullet-0"><span class="c4 c3">Tunc</span><span class="c1 c4">&nbsp;(1968)</span></li><li class="c8 c6 li-bullet-0"><span class="c4 c3">Nunquam</span><span class="c1 c4">&nbsp;(1970)</span></li></ul><p class="c5"><span class="c0">The protagonist, Felix Charlock, finds himself increasingly tied to the multinational corporation Merlins, which is most often simply called The Firm. He is both contractually and maritally tied to the Firm. His rebellion and attempt to escape leads to the death of his son and his own incarceration in a mental asylum. His lover at the beginning of the novel, Iolanthe, is likewise captured by the Firm through its net of contracts and capitalist acquisitions, ultimately leading to her death. In the second half of the work, </span><span class="c0 c3">Nunquam</span><span class="c1 c0">, Iolanthe is resurrected as a robot, which ultimately destroys itself along with the director of the Firm, Julian. The novel ends with the burning of the Firm&#39;s contracts, but no one knows if this will cause any change.</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c4 c3">The Avignon Quintet (1992)</span><span class="c1 c0">&nbsp;is a five-volume series of novels. The action of the novels is set before and during World War II, largely in France, Egypt, and Switzerland. The novels feature multiple and contradictory narrators. Durrell often referred to the work as a &quot;quincunx.&quot; The five novels are:</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c4 c3">Monsieur</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;(1974)</span><span class="c1 c0">&nbsp;won the 1974 James Tait Black Memorial Prize. Five characters, including Durrell (&quot;D&quot;), claim authorship of the book. In the first section &quot;Outremer,&quot; the protagonist and chief narrator Bruce Drexel, a diplomat like Durrell, returns to Provence after the suicide of his lover, Piers de Nogaret. Drexel, married to Piers&#39; sister Sylvie who is institutionalized, revisits Avignon with his friend Toby for the funeral, reminiscing about his past with Piers and Sylvie. &quot;Macabru&quot; recounts Bruce, Piers, and Sylvie&#39;s journey to Egypt years earlier, where they join a Gnostic cult led by Akkad. They travel to the oasis Macabru and take a long Nile River journey. In &quot;Sutcliffe, or the Venetian Documents,&quot; Robin Sutcliffe, a character in Aubrey Blanford&#39;s novel, narrates his misadventures in Venice and his failed marriage to Pia, Bruce&#39;s sister, suggesting the previous sections might be fictional. &quot;Life with Toby&quot; returns to Bruce and Toby in Avignon, discussing the Knights Templar and Gnostic themes, interrupted by &quot;The Green Notebook,&quot; which contains Sutcliffe&#39;s fragmentary notes. &quot;Dinner at Quartilla&#39;s&quot; reintroduces Blanford, claiming to have written the novel. He dines with the long-dead Duchess Tu. The novel ends with an Envoi, listing character connections without final resolution.</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c4 c3">Livia</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;(1978)</span><span class="c1 c0">&nbsp;the protagonist Aubrey Blanford, introduced in &quot;Monsieur,&quot; travels to Avignon to stay with his friends Sam and Hilary at their inherited chateau. They restore the property and enjoy an idyllic boat trip. The novel reveals &quot;Monsieur&quot; as the fictional work of Rob Sutcliffe, Blanford&#39;s alter ego, and introduces the real-life characters behind the fictional creations. Set in Provence before WWII, &quot;Livia&quot; opens with the death of Constance and ends with a debauch hosted by Prince Hassad as war looms. The friends, including Lord Galen, enjoy a last summer before the onset of Nazism. Galen, initially convinced by Hitler to invest in his plans, later regrets his decision and escapes Germany with Hassad, suffering financial losses. &quot;Livia&quot; retells &quot;Monsieur&quot; from a new perspective, focusing on Blanford, his wife Livia, and her sister Constance, mirroring the relationships in &quot;Monsieur.&quot; Blanford&#39;s fictional author Sutcliffe remains a key figure, and the single-word titles of the five books are Blanford&#39;s choice, while Sutcliffe prefers alternative titles.&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c4 c3">Constance</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;</span><span class="c4 c3">or Solitary Practices </span><span class="c4">(1982)</span><span class="c1 c0">&nbsp;was nominated for the Booker Prize in 1982. The novel is set during World War II, from the Nazi invasion of Poland in 1939 to the Allied invasion of Normandy in June 1944, with locations including Avignon, Geneva, Poland, and Egypt. The story continues in Avignon, focusing on Constance&#39;s growing relationship with her husband Sam. As war approaches, their European group from &quot;Livia&quot; disbands. Aubrey Blanford moves to Egypt for a job offered by Prince Hassad. During a visit from Sam, now a soldier, a picnic ends in disaster with Sam&#39;s death and Blanford&#39;s injury from friendly fire. Constance relocates to Geneva, where she learns of Sam&#39;s death. She later returns to Vichy-controlled France, living in the house of Tu Duc, where her sister Livia, now disfigured and suicidal, joins her. After Livia&#39;s suicide, Constance goes back to Geneva and starts an affair with Sebastian Affad, Prince Hassad&#39;s aide. Affad returns to Alexandria, facing disgrace among his Gnostic sect. Durrell then introduces characters from &quot;Monsieur,&quot; including its author Robin Sutcliffe, and Bruce Drexel. Cameo appearances from &quot;The Alexandria Quartet&quot; characters, such as David Mountolive, Maskelyne, Balthazar, Pursewarden, and Melissa, who has an affair with Affad, add to the interwoven narrative.</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c4 c3">Sebastian</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;</span><span class="c4 c3">or Ruling Passions</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;(1983)</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;A letter informs the Egyptian Sebastian Affad that he will die; a mix up has caused major ructions within the Gnostic sect in Egypt. Affad is called back to Egypt for admonishment. Before leaving Switzerland, however, he has asked Constance to use her psychiatric skills to treat his son, who has become autistic. She is gradually successful in working with the boy. After Affad returns to Switzerland from Egypt, the couple renew their relationship. The psychopath Mnemidis intervenes. After escaping from the institution where Constance works, he goes to her flat, intending to kill her, but murders Affad instead. The book finishes in a surreal manner. Affad seems virtually to disappear from Constance&#39;s memory; and two chapters give conflicting accounts of Constance&#39;s action upon the death of her boss Schwartz. Unexpectedly Sylvie reappears, for the first time since </span><span class="c0 c3">Monsieur.</span><span class="c1 c0">&nbsp;(She is said to be a fictional creation of author Aubrey Blanford, also introduced in the first novel as a character).

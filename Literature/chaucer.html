The poet taking it literally asks him not to pine over a game of chess. He explains that he set his heart on a woman and found her name to be "good, fair White". She reciprocated very late but finally he devoted herself to her. Later, the poet asks him the whereabouts of White and is informed that she is dead. After that, the poet awakes as the clocks trike 12 and decides that it should be set into rhyme.</span>

After falling asleep the poet finds himself in a glass temple adorned with images of the famous and their deeds. He thus deconstructs nature of fame and the trustworthiness of recorded renown. The poem begins with describing nature and causes of dreams. Then the poet starts by invocation to the god of sleep and asks him that no one should misjudge the meaning of his dream as he’s going to relate it in full.

Chaucer, the narrator, provides vivid descriptions of each pilgrim, highlighting their appearance, profession, and moral qualities. The Host, Harry Bailey, suggests a storytelling contest to entertain the group on their journey. The storyteller who tells the best tale will be rewarded with a free meal upon their return. The characters except Knight, Parson and Plowman are introduced with irony. He attacks church in individual characters of Monk, Friar, Nun, Nun’s priest and Summoner.

In this tale, told in decasyllabic couplets, a knight in King Arthur’s court is condemned to death for raping a young woman. However, the queen spares him and gives him the task of discovering what women most desire. The knight spends a year searching for an answer, and eventually, an old woman tells him that women most desire sovereignty (maistrye) over their husbands. The knight returns to the queen and tells her the answer, and as a reward, he is allowed to marry the old woman. At first, he is disgusted by her appearance, but she transforms into a beautiful woman after he allows her to choose their marriage’s direction.

However, the man outwits the friar and makes him believe he has received a gift, only to expose the friar's greed by tricking him into receiving a fart. The tale humorously mocks the corruption of the church and the greed of religious figures. The account of Friar going to a sick man is the most realistic account given.</span>

Walter tests her loyalty and patience by subjecting her to cruel trials, including taking away their children and pretending to marry another woman. Griselda remains obedient and humble throughout the trials. Eventually, Walter reveals that the trials were tests of her character, and she is rewarded with the return of her children and her husband’s love. The story explores the idea of unconditional love and patience, though it also raises questions about the imbalance of power in relationships. Chaucer interrupts towards the end as he feels bored by it. He says that neither should the wives be tested thus nor Clerks be led to write stories about them.</span>

It uses a frame story of confession of an ageing lover to the chaplain of Venus. First recension’s prologue says composed at the request of Richard II and was one of the most-often copied manuscripts of the time. It is inspired by Boethius' </span><em><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; color:#202122; background-color:#ffffff">Consolation of Philosophy</span></em><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; color:#202122; background-color:#ffffff">. It was dedicated to Richard II and to Geoffrey Chaucer "disciple and poete" of Venus. But the second recension removes them and adds Henry of Lancaster, the future Henry IV as dedicatee (as Macaulay believes). C. S. lweis sees "sweetness and freshness" in the verse and praises its "memorable precision and weight". In the prologue, de he identifies in the three estates (government, church, and people) of his time and gives an account of the dream of Nebuchadnezzar identifying the statue's feet of iron mixed with clay with the medieval world that Gower perceives as hopelessly divided and in danger of imminent collapse. He says he chose a middle approach (not of wit which dulls a man) in writing: “And wryte a bok betwen the tweie, / Somewhat of lust, somewhat of lore”. Amans or the Lover roams in a forest in May and being lovesick he invokes Venus and Cupid. Upon hearing he’s about to die, Venus summons her chaplain Genius to hear his confession. Later, Venus cures him of his infatuation. Genius leads Amans through the seven deadly sins, interpreting them in the context of the courtly love tradition. Each book of the poem shall be devoted to one sin: pride, envy, wrath, sloth, avarice, and gluttony (only six).

It begins in the Malvern Hills as Will falls asleep and has a vision of a tower set upon a hill and a fortress in a deep valley where he sees humankind being punished. They see King as a cat and his people as rodents who consider whether to bell the cat. Holy Church visits Will and explains the tower of Truth. Lady Mede ('payment') is to marry False and King proposes she marry Conscience while it denounces her and later Conscience and Reason convince the King not to marry Mede to False. Will wakes up. Reason gives a sermon to the Field of Folk and they repent. The Seven Deadly Sins make confession and decide to go on pilgrimage to St Truth. They get lost, and Piers Plowman makes his first appearance: he will help the penitents if they help him plough his half-acre. They do while those who refuse to work are punished by hunger which once satiates and they fall back to idleness. Truth sends Piers a pardon which is challenged by a priest as he sees it as a mere statement stating those who do good will be saved and those who do evil will be harmed; and Will is awakened. Now he starts seeking Do-wel. He falls asleep and meets Thought which instructs Will in 'Do well, do better, do best'. Wit, the guiding principal of all is seen. Later he sees confrontation of Dowel and the Castle of Flesh and sees the importance of being governed by 'Inwit'. Meets Wit's wife, Dame Study. Who rebukes him for his illiteracy. Goes to meet Clergy and Scripture to learn and Scripture rebukes him for his lack of self-knowledge. He has a dream-within-a-dream in which he meets Fortune. He serves her into old age, but she abandons him. Will has an argument with Reason as he informs it that it’s not enough for salvation. He meets Imaginatif, who advises Will to be patient. He awakes and falls back to sleep as Imaginatif teaches Will and focuses on need for humility and the importance of Grace. He then wakes and after sleeping dreams of sharing a feast with Conscience, Scripture, Clergy and Patience; he encounters a greedy Doctor of Divinity. Piers the Plowman offers a definition of Do Well, Do Better and Do Best. Conscience and Patience meet Haukyn the Active Man, who wears a coat of Christian faith which is, however, soiled with the Seven Deadly Sins. Conscience teaches Haukyn to seek forgiveness and do penance; Patience teaches Haukyn about the merits of embracing poverty. Haukyn cries out for God's mercy, which awakens Will. He meets Anima ('spirit') who talks of charity and he realizes that Piers the Plowman is Christ. He starts to search for Charity. He has another dream-within-a-dream, this time about the Tree of Charity, whose gardener is Piers the Plowman. He participates in re-enactment of the Fall of Man and then witnesses as the Devil is defeated. He meets Faith/Abraham, who is himself searching for Christ. Also meets Hope/Moses searching for Christ. He learns about the Good Samaritan and wakes up. He experiences Love and the intersection of human and divine time. Falls asleep again and witnesses the Four Daughters of God (Truth, Justice, Mercy, Peace) in debate; the Harrowing of Hell; and Redemption. Wakes up and now exhorts his family to hear Mass. In the Mass he falls back to sleep and meets Conscience once more. Conscience recounts the life and Passion of Christ and how Piers/Peter was given his power by Grace/Christ. Hears about Pentecost and sees Pride attacking Unity/Holy Church. Wakes up and Will meets Need. Sleeps and dreams of the Antichrist. Kynde sends Old Age, Death, and Pestilence, to chastise people: Will is attacked by Old Age. He witnesses Holy Church undermined by a hypocritical Friar. Conscience goes on pilgrimage to seek Piers the Plowman, and calls on Grace for help—whereupon Will wakes up.</span>

Book 1 begins with written correspondence between Thomas More and several people he had met in Europe: </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; background-color:#ffffff">Peter Gilles</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; color:#202122; background-color:#ffffff">, town clerk of </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; background-color:#ffffff">Antwerp</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; color:#202122; background-color:#ffffff">, and </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; background-color:#ffffff">Hieronymus van Busleyden</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; color:#202122; background-color:#ffffff">, counselor to </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; background-color:#ffffff">Charles V</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; color:#202122; background-color:#ffffff">. He explain the lack of widespread travel to Utopia which gives it air of authenticity since someone had coughed during announcement of the exact longitude and latitude. The first book tells of the traveller Raphael Hythlodaeus (whose name alludes both to the healer archangel </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; background-color:#ffffff">Raphael</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; color:#202122; background-color:#ffffff">, and 'speaker of nonsense', the surname's Greek meaning), to whom More is introduced in Antwerp, and it also explores the subject of how best to counsel a prince, a popular topic at the time. He recounts modern ills in Europe such as the tendency of kings to start wars and the subsequent loss of money on fruitless endeavours. He criticises the use of execution to punish theft which is same for murder and one robbing will thus easily be persuaded to murder. Favours the abstract principle being "never to make it safer to follow out an evil plan than to repent of it." He lays most of the problems of theft on the practice of </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; background-color:#ffffff">enclosure</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; color:#202122; background-color:#ffffff">, the enclosing of common land, and the subsequent poverty and starvation of people who are denied access to land because of </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; background-color:#ffffff">sheep farming</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; color:#202122; background-color:#ffffff">. More asks him to get a job in a royal court to advise monarchs but he says he’s too radical for that. Raphael sees himself in the tradition of </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; background-color:#ffffff">Plato</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; color:#202122; background-color:#ffffff">: he knows that for good governance, kings must act philosophically. Book 2: Raphael's travels in with </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; background-color:#ffffff">Amerigo Vespucci</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; color:#202122; background-color:#ffffff">'s real life voyages of discovery. He </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">links Raphael's travels with Amerigo Vespucci's real life voyages of discovery.

It contains 54 cities. Each city is divided into four equal parts. The capital city, Amaurot, is located directly in the middle of the crescent island. Each city has not more than 6000 households, each family consisting of between 10 and 16 adults. Thirty households are grouped together and elect a </span><em><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; color:#202122; background-color:#ffffff">Syphograntus</span></em><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; color:#202122; background-color:#ffffff"> (whom More says is now called a </span><em><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; color:#202122; background-color:#ffffff">phylarchus</span></em><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; color:#202122; background-color:#ffffff">).

The 200 Syphogranti of a city elect a Prince in a secret ballot. The Prince stays for life unless he is deposed or removed for suspicion of tyranny. If the island suffers from overpopulation, colonies are set up on the mainland. There is no </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; background-color:#ffffff">private property</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; color:#202122; background-color:#ffffff"> on Utopia, with goods being stored in </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; background-color:#ffffff">warehouses</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; color:#202122; background-color:#ffffff"> and people requesting what they need. Also, no locks on the doors of the houses, and the houses are rotated between the citizens every ten years. Main economical practice is agriculture and everyone has to do farming for two years at a time before joining essential trades: weaving (mainly done by the women), carpentry, </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; background-color:#ffffff">metalsmithing</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; color:#202122; background-color:#ffffff"> and </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; background-color:#ffffff">masonry</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; color:#202122; background-color:#ffffff">. There are no </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; background-color:#ffffff">dressmakers</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; color:#202122; background-color:#ffffff"> making fine apparel. All able-bodied citizens must work; thus, unemployment is eradicated. </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; background-color:#ffffff">Slavery</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; color:#202122; background-color:#ffffff"> is a feature of Utopian life, and it is reported that every household has two slaves. Slaves come from prisoners of war, people condemned to die, or poor people, Utopian criminals etc. The criminals are weighed down with </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; background-color:#ffffff">chains</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; color:#202122; background-color:#ffffff"> made out of gold. Gold is used in </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; background-color:#ffffff">chamber pots</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; color:#202122; background-color:#ffffff"> to make it loathsome. Jewels are worn by children, who finally give them up as they mature. It is a </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; background-color:#ffffff">welfare state</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; color:#202122; background-color:#ffffff"> with free hospitals, </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; background-color:#ffffff">euthanasia</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; color:#202122; background-color:#ffffff"> permissible by the state, priests being allowed to marry, divorce permitted, </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; background-color:#ffffff">premarital sex</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; color:#202122; background-color:#ffffff"> punished by a lifetime of enforced celibacy and adultery being punished by enslavement. There are community </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; background-color:#ffffff">dining halls</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; color:#202122; background-color:#ffffff">. Although all are fed the same, Raphael explains that the old and the administrators are given the best of the food. There is an </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; background-color:#ffffff">internal passport</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; color:#202122; background-color:#ffffff"> that citizens have. If one is caught without it, he’s sent away in disgrace and on second occasion is enslaved. Since the law is made simple to understand, there are no lawyers. There are several religions on the island: </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; background-color:#ffffff">moon-worshippers</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; color:#202122; background-color:#ffffff">, </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; background-color:#ffffff">sun-worshippers</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; color:#202122; background-color:#ffffff">, </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; background-color:#ffffff">planet-worshippers</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; color:#202122; background-color:#ffffff">, </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; background-color:#ffffff">ancestor-worshippers</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; color:#202122; background-color:#ffffff"> and </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; background-color:#ffffff">monotheists</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; color:#202122; background-color:#ffffff">, but each is tolerant of the others. Only </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; background-color:#ffffff">atheists</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; color:#202122; background-color:#ffffff"> are despised (but allowed) in Utopia, as they are seen as representing a danger to the state and are encouraged to talk out their erroneous beliefs with the priests. Raphael says that through his teachings Christianity was beginning to take hold in Utopia. Wives are subject to their husbands and husbands are subject to their wives although women are restricted to conducting household tasks for the most part.

				<span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; color:#202122; background-color:#ffffff">Biblical scholar and linguist, a leading figure in the Protestant Reformation who was influenced by the works of prominent Protestant Reformers such as Martin Luther. He posed a direct challenge to the authority of the Catholic Church. Gave direct challenge to the authority of the Catholic Church by King Henry VIII. He left England and sought refuge in the Flemish territory of the Catholic Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor but was later arrested in 1535. He was convicted of heresy and executed by strangulation after which his body was burnt at the stake. His biblical translation was re-used by subsequent English editions including Henry VIII’s the Great Bible and the Bishops' Bible. Later, the King James Version also used it. Luther's translation of the Christian Bible into German appeared between 1517 and 1522. His final words, spoken "at the stake with a fervent zeal, and a loud voice", were reported later as "Lord! Open the King of England's eyes." Tyndale's death is commemorated on 6 October. George Steiner in his book on translation After Babel refers to "the influence of the genius of Tyndale, the greatest of English Bible translators."</span>

Furthermore, it was the first English biblical translation that was mass-produced as a result of new advances in the art of printing. The term "Tyndale's Bible" is not strictly correct, because Tyndale never published a complete English language Bible; instead, a completely translated Bible was completed by Myles Coverdale, who supplemented Tyndale's translations with his own to produce the first complete printed Bible in English in 1535.</span>

He defends archery against claims that it was a sport unbefitting a scholar. It’s written in the form of a dialogue between two characters, Philologus ("a lover of study") and Toxophilus ("a lover of the bow"), who is also a scholar and defends archery as a noble pastime. Important as a model for how books of instruction could be written in English (rather than Latin) and how English could be written in a clear style, for as he remarks in his preface "To All Gentle Men and Yeomen of England": "Many English writers have not done so, but using strange words, as Latin, French, and Italian, do make all things dark and hard." He avoided neologisms and flowery classical terms, and "succeeded in making his English work as a vehicle of wide communication ... Some of the passages describing the environment (for example, the way in which the wind could interfere with the aim of an expert archer) were vivid and at the time unparalleled in English writing." The term toxophilus is his invention. The next major work on archery in English was The Art of Archerie by Gervase Markham, published in London in 1634.</span>

The Scholemaster was the result. The book concentrates on the teaching of Latin and is not intended for schools, but "specially prepared for the private brynging up of youth in gentlemen and noblemens houses". It advocated "the double translation of a model book", the book recommended being Sturmius's Select Letters of Cicero. The book's plea for gentleness and persuasion instead of coercion in schools, was contemporary: it was being practised and preached at that time by Christopher Jonson (c. 1536–1597) at Winchester College; and had been repeatedly urged by Erasmus and others. Along with its suggestions for educational practice, Ascham's book includes a famous warning against the dangers of Italy, which he calls "inchantementes of Circes". He also attacks use of rhyme.

The final publication would then help shape the depiction and legend of Mary I as "Bloody Mary". With the polemical account of the sufferings of Protestants under the Catholic Church, with particular emphasis on England and Scotland, Protestant apologists such as Calvinist Anglican John Foxe "sought to establish the continuity of a proto-Protestant piety from apostolic times to the Reformation." It was to that time the largest publishing project ever undertaken in England. Foxe's temporal range was "from the yeare of our Lorde a thousand unto the tyme nowe present". The illustrations were newly cut to depict particular details, linking England's suffering back to "the primitive tyme" until, in volume I, "the reigne of King Henry VIII"; in volume two, from H "Queen Elizabeth our gracious Lady now reigning." "[Bishop] Edmund Grindal called it a book of martyrs, and the name stuck." Foxe wrote “I wrote no such booke bearying the title Booke of Martyrs. I wrote a booke called the Acts and Monumentes ... wherin many other matters be contayned beside the martyrs of Christ.” John Burrow refers to it as, after the Bible, "the greatest single influence on English Protestant thinking of the late Tudor and early Stuart period."</span>

				<span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">His scientific method based in scepticism was a new rhetorical and theoretical framework for science is inductive reasoning and argued the importance of natural philosophy, guided by scientific method. Bacon was a patron of libraries and developed a system for cataloguing books under three categories – history, poetry, and philosophy. "Some books are to be tasted; others swallowed; and some few to be chewed and digested." Bacon became Attorney general. Bacon's public career ended in disgrace in 1621 with the charges of him getting bribes from litigants. As he fell into debt, he was committed to the Tower of London for some days before being released by the king. Then the disgraced viscount devoted himself to study and writing. Bacon was a devout Anglican. "Knowledge is the rich storehouse for the glory of the Creator and the relief of man's estate.” He wrote in </span><em><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; ">The Essays</span></em><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">: </span><em><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; ">Of Atheism</span></em><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">, "a little philosophy inclineth man's mind to atheism; but depth in philosophy bringeth men's minds about to religion."

In</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">"Of Superstition" Bacon remarks, "Atheism leaves a man to sense, to philosophy, to natural piety, to laws, to reputation; all which may be guides to an outward moral virtue, though religion was not; but superstition dismounts all these, and erecteth an absolute monarchy in the minds of men. Therefore atheism did never perturb states; for it makes men wary of themselves, as looking no further: and we see the times inclined to atheism (as the time of Augustus Cæsar) were civil times. But superstition hath been the confusion of many states, and bringeth in a new primum mobile, that ravished all the spheres of government". Percy Bysshe Shelley cites this passage in his essay The Necessity of Atheism. In his </span><em><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; ">Brief Lives</span></em><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'"> (1665–1690 and published as a book in 1813), antiquary John Aubrey wrote that Bacon was a pederast.

The text consists of an elderly teacher's lecturing his student on the dangers of classical philosophy. The teacher teaches his student: "By mixing the divine with the natural, the profane with the sacred, heresies with mythology, you have corrupted, O you sacrilegious impostor, both human and religious truth." He traces the corruption of human knowledge though classical philosopher to a contemporary alchemist. First his diatribe is against ancient philosophers with Aristotle, who initially leads, for Bacon, the human mind awry by turning its attention toward words: “this man presumed to cast the closest fetters on our understandings. He composed an art or manual of madness and made us slaves to words.” Aristotle's crime of duping the intellect into the belief that words possess an intrinsic connection with Nature confused the subjective and the objective. “My dear, dear boy, what I propose is to unite you with things themselves in a chaste, holy, and legal wedlock.” Although, as the text presents it, the student has not yet reached that point of intellectual and sexual maturity, the elderly guide assures him that once he has properly distanced himself from Nature he will then be able to bring forth “a blessed race of Heroes and Supermen who will overcome the immeasurable helplessness and poverty of the human race.”</span>

He argues that the man who succeeds in "kindling a light in nature", would be "the benefactor indeed of the human race, the propagator of man's empire over the universe, the champion of liberty, the conqueror and subduer of necessities". He says "had been born for the service of mankind" and that he will do. In the first chapter, "Of the Limits and End of Knowledge", he discusses limits and true ends of pursuing knowledge through sciences. He disavows both the knowledge and the power that is not dedicated to goodness or love, and as such, that all the power achieved by man through science must be subject to " that use for which God hath granted it; which is the benefit and relief of the state and society of man; for otherwise, all manner of knowledge becometh malign and serpentine; ...as the Scripture saith excellently, knowledge bloweth up, but charity buildeth up". He present conditions in society and government that were preventing the advancement of knowledge and considers the increase of knowledge in sciences not only as "a plant of God's own planting", but also as the fulfilling of a prophecy made by Daniel in the Old Testament. This quote from the Book of Daniel appears also in the title page of Bacon's Instauratio Magna and Novum Organum, in Latin: "Multi pertransibunt &amp; augebitur scientia".</span>

It’s</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">a pioneering essay in support of empirical philosophy. Bacon starts giving philosophical, civic and religious arguments for engaging in the aim of advancing learning. He analyses the state of the sciences of his day, stating what was being done incorrectly. He talks about the arguments against learning by theologians, politicians and the habits of learned men. About the last one he enlists 3 vanities which becomes target against learning: verbalism; delight in deceiving and getting deceived and finally imposture and credulity. Thus gives divine and human proofs of its bliss. Learned kingdoms are superior to the unlearned, e.g. King Solomon, the biblical king who had established a school of natural research, and gave discourses on how knowledge should be used for the "glory of the Creator" and "the relief of man's estate", if only it was governed by charity. In the second book, he divided human understanding into three parts: history, related to man's faculty of memory; poetry, related to man's faculty of imagination; and philosophy, pertaining to man's faculty of reason. From the combination of the three branches (history, poetry, and philosophy) and three aspects (divine, human and natural) a series of different sciences are deduced. Divisions: He divided </span><strong><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; ">History</span></strong><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'"> in: divine history, or the History of religion; human or political history; and Natural History. </span><strong><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; ">Poetry</span></strong><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'"> (which he defines in Freudian terms as something which ‘erects’ mind through a show of things that it desires while reason ‘buckle[s]’ it down to nature of things as they are)</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">he divided in: narrative (natural/historical) poetry; dramatic (human) poetry, the kind of which "the ancients used to educate the minds of men to virtue"; and divine (parabolic) poetry, in which "the secrets and mysteries of religion, policy, and philosophy are involved in fables or parables". </span><strong><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; ">Philosophy</span></strong><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'"> he divided in: divine, natural and human, which he referred to as the triple character of the power of God, the difference of nature, and the use of man. There are then the subdivisions: he divided divine philosophy in natural theology (or the lessons of God in Nature) and revealed theology (or the lessons of God in the sacred scriptures), and natural philosophy in physics, metaphysics, mathematics (which included music, astronomy, geography, architecture, engineering), and medicine. For human philosophy, he meant the study of mankind itself, the kind of which leads to self-knowledge, through the study of the mind and the soul – which suggests resemblance with modern psychology. He also took into consideration rhetoric, communication, and transmission of knowledge. It was published in Latin as </span><em><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; ">De Augmentis Scientiarum</span></em><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">.

				<strong><em><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; ">The Wisdom of the Ancients</span></em></strong><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'"> (1609) he claims playfully to unveil the hidden meanings and teachings behind ancient Greek fables. With two dedications: one to the Earl of Salisbury, the other to the University of Cambridge. Starts with a detailed Preface, in which Bacon explains how ancient wisdom is contained within the fables. He opens the Preface stating that fables are the poets' veiling of the "most ancient times that are buried in oblivion and silence". He retells thirty-one ancient fables and discusses how they contain hidden teachings on varied issues such as morality, philosophy, religion, civility, politics, science, and art. He thus sees a rift between past and present as well as a connection to "an ancient, but previously lost, precedent for free inquiry." Two of the chapters, "Cupid; or the Atom", and "Proteus; or Matter" may be considered part of Bacon's scientific philosophy. Bacon describes in "Cupid" his vision of the nature of the atom and of matter itself. 'Love' is described as the force or the "instinct" of primal matter, "the natural motion of the atom", "the summary law of nature, that impulse of desire impressed by God upon the primary particles of matter which makes them come together, and which by repetition and multiplication produces all the variety of nature", "a thing which mortal thought may glance at, but can hardly take in". Bacon finds Proteus to symbolize all matter in the universe: "For the person of Proteus denotes matter, the oldest of all things, after God himself; that resides, as in a cave, under the vast concavity of the heavens". Proteus's ability to elude his would-be captors by shifting into various forms.</span>

Bacon planned his Great Instauration in imitation of the Divine Work – the Work of the Six Days of Creation, as defined in the Bible, leading to the Seventh Day of Rest or Sabbath in which Adam's dominion over creation would be restored, dividing the great reformation in six parts: Partitions of the Sciences (De Augmentis Scientiarum); New Method (Novum Organum); Natural History (Historia Naturalis); Ladder of the Intellect (Scala Intellectus); Anticipations of the Second Philosophy (Anticipationes Philosophiæ Secunda) and The Second Philosophy or Active Science (Philosophia Secunda aut Scientia Activæ). For Bacon, restoration of science was part of the "partial returning of mankind to the state it lived before the fall". For Bacon, this reformation would lead to a great advancement in science and a progeny of new inventions that would relieve mankind's miseries and needs. He has two admonishions for those practicing science. First is related to the limit of science: questioning nature is forbidden by divine law and thus should be the limit; secondly about the ends of science: not for pleasure, contention, superiority over others, profit, fame, or power, but for the benefit and use of life, and that they perfect and govern it in charity.

Thus, induction presupposes the possibility of intelligent sensory observation. Deduction begins with general axioms ("highest" or "middle"), which might be viewed as first principles or as inductively derived principles, on the basis of which it is possible to derive a systematic, i.e., scientific, knowledge of things. Bacon presents his famous Idols (Idola) as rejection of received doctrine of man-made impediments which mislead the mind's objective reasoning. 1. Idols of the Tribe: rooted in human nature itself and in the very tribe or race of men. 2. Idols of the Cave: "belong to the particular individual” and stems from the particular life experiences of the individual. 3. Idols of the Market: "derived as if from the mutual agreement and association of the human race” "the greatest nuisances of them all". Because humans reason through the use of words they are particularly dangerous, because the received definitions of words, which are often falsely derived, can cause confusion. He divides them into two subsets of this kind of idol: words which spring from fallacious theories, such as the element of fire or the concept of a first mover are easy to dismantle; words that are the result of imprecise abstraction such as Earth. These terms are often used elliptically, or from a lack of information or definition of the term. 4. Idols of the Theatre: unwise acceptance of certain philosophical dogmas.</span>

The formal cause which is both the most illusive and most valuable. By forms and formal causes, Bacon means the universal laws of nature. Bacon attempts to grasp the form of heat. In finding the cause of a 'phenomenal nature' such as heat, one must list all of the situations where heat is found and he calls such a compilation </span><em><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; ">Table of Essence and Presence</span></em><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">.

A third table lists situations where heat can vary and draws categories (</span><em><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; ">Table of Degrees</span></em><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">). Then through comparison, elimination of certain instances of heat is done and the hypothesis that is derived from this eliminative induction he calls </span><em><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; ">The First Vintage</span></em><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'"> which is the first step in observation. The 'form nature', or cause, of heat must be that which is common to all instances in the first table, is lacking from all instances of the second table and varies by degree in instances of the third table. He then describes Instances with Special Powers (27 in total). Then goes on to enumerate (not elaborate upon) "aids to the intellect". Bacon lays out the subsequent series of steps in proper induction: including Supports to Induction, Rectification of Induction, Varying the Inquiry according to the Nature of the Subject, Natures with Special Powers, Ends of Inquiry, Bringing Things down to Practice, Preparatives to Inquiry and Ascending and Descending Scale of Axioms.

He acknowledges that life is a “mass and accumulation of sins and sorrows” but prolonged life can make possible “the continuation of works of charity”. He then recalls examples of apostles, saints, monks and hermits whose prolonged life was seen as a blessing in the old law. Bacon inquires for the causes of the degeneration of the body and old age and experiments for possible remedies to them that could prolong life and retard the process of degeneration of the body. Alimentation, conditions of mind/feeling, correct relationship between body and spirit are included as vital for one's health. Bacon takes into consideration the emotional and mental states that are prejudicial or profitable in the prolonging of life: he sees emotions such as grief, fear, hate, unquietness, morose, envy as the prejudicial and love, compassion, joy, hope, and admiration and light contemplation as profitable.</span>

				<strong><em><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; ">New Atlantis</span></em></strong><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'"> (1627) incomplete utopian novel, it was not until 1670 that it was included on Sylva's letterpress title page. Bacon portrayed a vision of the future of human discovery and knowledge, expressing his aspirations and ideals for humankind. The novel depicts the creation of a utopian land where "generosity and enlightenment, dignity and splendour, piety and public spirit" are the commonly held qualities of the inhabitants of the mythical Bensalem. The plan and organisation of his ideal college, Salomon's House (or Solomon's House), prefigured the modern research university in both applied and pure sciences. He described his utopian island as being "the chastest nation under heaven", with "no touch" of "masculine love". The novel follows the discovery of the mythical island of Bensalem by a European ship lost in the Pacific Ocean west of Peru. The story gradually unveils the customs, religion, and scientific achievements of the island. Bensalem is a Christian society, claiming its faith began with the miraculous arrival of a copy of the Bible and a letter from Saint Bartholomew. The governor of the House of Strangers is Joabin the Jew. The society values family, celebrated in the “Feast of the Family,” and is characterized by high moral standards, chastity, and incorruptibility. Central to Bensalem is Salomon’s House, a state-sponsored scientific institution described as “the very eye of the kingdom.” It is dedicated to understanding nature, performing experiments, and applying knowledge to improve society. Members of the House are assigned specialized roles, including gathering knowledge from other nations (merchants of light), testing experiments (pioneers), and analyzing and refining discoveries (interpreters of nature). "The end of our foundation is the knowledge of causes, and secret motions of things; and the enlarging of the bounds of human empire, to the effecting of all things possible". The experimentation as explained by the head has different levels and thus different employees are involved: he explains “We have three” who are “depredators” or those who do literature survey; 3 who are called “mystery–men” who study mechanical arts and those acts not included in science; 3 who are called “pioneers or miners” who try new experiments; 3 “compilers” who tabulate the previous 4 activities; 3 “dowry–men or benefactors” who direct how to draw results from experiments; 3 “lamps” who learn from present experiments how to direct new ones; 3 “inoculators” who actually do experiments and finally 3 “interpreters of nature” who draw out axioms (generalizations) from the experiments. The Head of Salomon’s House explains its purpose: to uncover the causes and secrets of creation and expand human capabilities. Daily prayers and hymns express gratitude to God for their work. In the final section, the Head grants a European visitor permission to share the knowledge of Salomon’s House with the outside world. Jonathan Swift parodied it; B. F.

The first sentence shows how people think that doctors should have no religion. Later moves on to show reason and faith as two contrary things but they are united in God’s Wisdom as are God’s work and God’s word in Nature in which nothing is grotesque.

Browne's three determinants for obtaining truth were the authority of past scholarly works, the act of reason, and empirical experience. Each of these determinants is employed upon subjects ranging from common folklore to the cosmological. Subjects covered are: the learned doctor essaying on the nature of error itself (Book 1), continuing with fallacies in the mineral, vegetable (Book 2), and animal (Book 3) kingdoms onto errors concerning Man (Book 4), Art (Book 5), Geography and History (Book 6), and finally Astronomy and the Cosmos (Book 7). The second of Pseudodoxia Epidemica's seven books entitled Tenets concerning Mineral and Vegetable Bodies includes Browne's experiments with static electricity and magnetism—the word electricity being one of hundreds of neologisms.

He begins with a description of the antiquities found, and then a survey of most of the burial and funerary customs, ancient and current, of which his era was aware. The most famous part of the work is the apotheosis of the fifth chapter, where Browne declaims: “But man is a Noble Animal, splendid in ashes, and pompous in the grave, solemnizing Nativities and Deaths with equal lustre, nor omitting Ceremonies of bravery, in the infamy of his nature. Life is a pure flame, and we live by an invisible Sun within us.” It contains the famous passage that begins with “What song the Syrens sang,...” which contains “But to subsist in bones, and be Pyramidally extant, is a fallacy in duration”.

Browne's major literary contribution to Hermetic wisdom. The book begins with the biblical creation, allusions to Plato's discourse the Timaeus and speculation upon the __cpLocation of the Garden of Eden. It continues on orchard planting patterns of the Ancient Persians, who used the quincunx pattern to ensure "a regular angularity, and through prospect, was left on every side". Browne explores the number five and the quincunx pattern as seen in art and human design (chapters 1 and 2) as a pattern in nature, in particular through his extensive study of botany (central chapter 3) and mystically (chapters 4 and 5). Browne's contribution to a "boom period" decade of interest in esoterica in England. Browne's discourse is a neoplatonic and neopythagorean vision of the interconnection of art and nature via the inter-related symbols of the number five and the quincunx pattern, along with the figure X and the lattice design. Its fundamental quest was of primary concern to Hermetic philosophy: proof of the wisdom of God, and demonstrable evidence of intelligent design. The discourse includes early recorded usage of the words "prototype" and "archetype" in English. The 19th- and 20th-century critic Edmund Gosse complained of the book that "gathering his forces it is Quincunx, Quincunx, all the way until the very sky itself is darkened with revolving Chess-boards", while conceding that "this radically bad book contains some of the most lovely paragraphs which passed from an English pen during the seventeenth century".</span>

It was reprinted five times; permeated by quotations from and paraphrases of many authorities, both classical and contemporary, the culmination of a lifetime of erudition. It was only the revelation of Laurence Sterne's plagiarism that revived interest in Burton's work into the 19th century, especially among the Romantics. Burton wrote in the </span><em><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; ">Anatomy</span></em><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'"> that students "think no slavery in the world (as once I did myself) like to that of a Grammar Scholar". It is presented as a medical textbook in which Burton applies his vast and varied learning, in the scholastic manner, to the subject of melancholia (or clinical depression) but is a sui generis (unique) work of literature as it is a scientific or philosophical text, as Burton covers far more than the titular subject. He uses melancholy as a lens through which all human emotion and thought may be scrutinized. In the satirical preface he says "I write of melancholy by being busy to avoid melancholy." There are humorous digressions addressing topics such as digestion, goblins, the geography of America, and others. He states “Melancholy, the subject of our present discourse, is either in disposition or in habit… In which equivocal and improper sense, we call him melancholy, that is dull, sad, sour, lumpish, ill-disposed, solitary, any way moved, or displeased…. Melancholy in this sense is the character of Mortality.” Burton drew from nearly every science of his day, including psychology and physiology, but also astronomy, meteorology, theology, and even astrology and demonology. Although his "citations" sound convincing, many are incorrect, taken out of context, or simply fabricated. Characteristically, the introduction includes not only an author's note (titled "Democritus Junior to the Reader"), but also a Latin poem ("Democritus Junior to His Book"), a warning to "The Reader Who Employs His Leisure Ill", an abstract of the following text, and another poem explaining the frontispiece. Then the first section focuses on the causes and symptoms of "common" melancholies, the second section deals with cures for melancholy, and the third section explores more complex and esoteric melancholies, including the melancholy of lovers and all manner of religious melancholies. The famous section is “heroic or love melancholy”. He says Bedlam is full of such deaths love causes.</span>

The work closed with a general "Review and Conclusion", in response to the war, which answered the question: Does a subject have the right to change allegiance when a former sovereign's power to protect is irrevocably lost? Aside from social contract theory, Leviathan also popularized ideas such as the state of nature ("war of all against all") and laws of nature. The book is divided into 4 parts.</span>

				<strong><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; ">Part I</span></strong><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">: “Of Man”: This section focuses on human nature and the mechanisms of perception, reasoning, and passions. He starts by his unsentimental laying down of facts: everything about humanity can be explained materialistically. He says “Life is but a motion of limbs.” Then he says that terms like Good and evil and Hope are merely driven by “appetites and desires” of a society and have no inherent meaning. Scholasticism, thrives on confused definitions of everyday words like incorporeal substance which are nonsensical. There is no </span><em><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; ">summum bonum</span></em><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">, or greatest good that a society can go after: The result would be civil war. But there is a </span><em><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; ">summum malum</span></em><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">, or greatest evil which is the fear of violent death. A political community can be oriented around this fear. He introduces the concept of the "state of nature," a pre-political condition where life is anarchic and violent due to the absence of authority, summarizing it as "solitary, poor, nasty, brutish, and short", a state of “a war of all against all”. In such a state, there is no place for industry, no arts, no letters, no society. So, the polestar of political reasoning is the malum. Hobbes discusses how humans, driven by self-interest and the desire to avoid pain, naturally seek peace through reason but are also prone to conflict due to competition, mistrust, and the pursuit of glory. Then he starts expanding laws of nature.</span>

				<strong><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; ">Part II</span></strong><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'"> “Of Commonwealth”: Owing to the foresight of their own preservation under threat from malum, men put restraint upon themselves ("social contract,"): “I authorise and give up my right of governing myself to this man, or to this assembly of men, on this condition; that thou give up, thy right to him, and authorise all his actions in like manner.” Then he lays 12 principal rights of sovereign which also forbids regicide, revolt etc. He then describes three types: monarchy, aristocracy and democracy; monarchy is the best. The right of succession always lies with the sovereign. Also, sovereign has authority to assert power over matters of faith and doctrine and that if he does not do so, he invites discord. God himself was a corporeal substance. Also talks of equal imposition of taxes. Hobbes describes this sovereign—metaphorically called the Leviathan—as a necessary and absolute authority to prevent societal collapse into chaos.</span>

				<strong><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; ">Part III</span></strong><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'"> “Of a Christian Commonwealth”:</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">This part explores the relationship between religion and politics, asserting that the sovereign has authority over religious practices to maintain social harmony. Hobbes critiques religious divisions and insists that the interpretation of scripture should align with the laws of the sovereign. He goes on to ask which scriptures we should trust, and why. He says if one claims supernatural revelation to be superior to the civil law there will be chaos since anyone can claim God spoke to them. Thus, we need a test (of whether they are lying or not): and the true test is established by examining the books of scripture. Since only Bible is to be trusted, he discusses the various books which are accepted by various sects. "The question truly stated is: by what authority they are made law?" He claims that no-one can know for sure anyone else's divine revelation and thus concludes that the religious power is subordinate to the civil. He aims to integrate religion within the framework of political obedience, ensuring it supports the stability of the commonwealth.</span>

				<strong><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; ">Part One</span></strong><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">: “Behemoth, or the Epitome of the Civil Wars of England”: The dialogue begins with a discussion of the roots of the English Civil War, focusing on the breakdown of authority. Hobbes traces the origins of rebellion to the educational system, particularly universities like Oxford and Cambridge, which perpetuated classical Aristotelian philosophy and theological disputes. These teachings, according to Hobbes, nurtured disobedience and intellectual arrogance, leading to challenges against the monarchy. Hobbes criticizes the Puritans and other Protestant sects for their rejection of the Church of England’s authority. These groups, he argues, introduced radical ideas of equality and spiritual autonomy that eroded social cohesion. Hobbes points to the influence of popular preachers and pamphleteers, who fueled discontent among the populace.</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">He also highlights the role of ambitious politicians and nobles in exploiting public grievances to weaken the monarchy.

Hobbes examines the social and economic factors that contributed to the rebellion, such as disputes over taxation and property rights. He describes the execution of King Charles I as a catastrophic moment that marked the ultimate failure of political authority and the dissolution of the social contract. Hobbes critiques the rise of the Commonwealth under Oliver Cromwell, viewing it as an illegitimate regime built on rebellion and coercion. He emphasizes the anarchy and instability that characterized this period, arguing that the absence of a strong central authority led to widespread violence and suffering. Hobbes highlights the dangers of divided loyalty, particularly when individuals prioritize religious or ideological affiliations over their allegiance to the sovereign. He stresses that such divisions inevitably lead to conflict and societal breakdown.</span>

				<strong><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; ">Part Three</span></strong><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'"> “The English Civil War, Rise of Cromwell, and Execution of Charles I”: Hobbes examines the role of religion in exacerbating the conflict. He criticizes the clergy and religious leaders who claimed divine authority to justify rebellion against the king. Hobbes argues that these claims undermined the legitimacy of the sovereign and encouraged insubordination. The dialogue also explores the fragmentation of religious authority during this period, with the proliferation of sects and interpretations of scripture. Hobbes contends that this religious pluralism created confusion and discord, further destabilizing society. He calls for the subordination of religion to civil authority, arguing that the sovereign must have the power to regulate religious practices and doctrines to maintain social harmony. Hobbes’s critique of religious divisions extends to his condemnation of superstition and the misuse of scripture. He argues that the manipulation of religious beliefs for political purposes is a key factor in the breakdown of order.</span>

Hobbes views the Restoration as a return to natural order, driven by the human desire for stability and peace after years of chaos. He reflects on the lessons of the civil war, emphasizing the importance of a strong, centralized authority in preventing future conflicts. Hobbes reaffirms his belief in the necessity of the sovereign’s control over religious and political life. He critiques the idea of popular sovereignty, arguing that it leads to disorder and rebellion. The dialogue ends with a stark warning about the dangers of divided authority and the need for absolute obedience to the sovereign.</span>

The phrase was in origin a dismissal of eclecticism, i.e. the "fear" is of the formidable intellectual opponent who has dedicated himself to and become a master in a single chosen discipline. In this first sense, the phrase was invoked by Methodist founder John Wesley to refer to himself, with "one book" (unius libri) taken to mean the Bible.

				<span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">English poet, was murdered in prison in 1613. He opposed his friend Robert Carr's affair with Frances Howard, leading to tension. Overbury wrote a poem “</span><strong><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; ">A Wife</span></strong><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">” (depicted the virtues that a young man should demand of a woman), criticizing Frances, which upset her. James I offered Overbury an ambassadorship, which he declined, angering the king. In April 1613, Overbury was imprisoned in the Tower of London. Frances Howard and Carr were worried that Overbury might interfere with their plans, including her annulment from her first husband, Robert Devereux. Overbury died on 14 September 1613 and rumors of foul play began. In 1615, an investigation revealed that Overbury was poisoned in prison with copper vitriol. Richard Weston (gaoler) and Anne Turner (widow of a physician) were involved in poisoning Overbury.</span>

The Lady of Shalott lives in an island castle in a river which flows to </span><span class="c0">Camelot</span><span class="c3 c0">, but the local farmers know little about her. She suffers from a mysterious curse and must continually weave images on her loom without ever looking directly out at the world. Instead, she looks into a mirror, which reflects the busy road and the people of Camelot who pass by her island. Thus she sees &nbsp;&quot;shadows of the world&quot;. Then the &nbsp;&quot;bold </span><span class="c0">Sir Lancelot</span><span class="c8 c3 c0">&quot; rides by and is seen by the lady upon which she stops weaving and looks out of her window toward Camelot, bringing about the curse. She leaves her tower, finds a boat upon which she writes her name, and floats down the river to Camelot. &nbsp;She dies before arriving at the palace.</span></p><p class="c5 c13"><span class="c3">3.</span><span class="c3 c17">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; </span><span class="c1 c6 c0">The Lotos-Eaters</span><span class="c3 c0">&nbsp;(rev. 1842) inspired by his trip to Spain with his close friend </span><span class="c0">Arthur Hallam</span><span>. </span><span class="c3 c0">The poem describes a group of mariners who, upon eating the </span><span class="c0">lotos</span><span class="c3 c0">, are put into an </span><span class="c0">altered state</span><span class="c8 c3 c0">&nbsp;and isolated from the outside world.

Tennyson was a guest of the Arundel family in their stately home named </span><span class="c0">Loxley Hall</span><span class="c3 c0">, in </span><span class="c0">Staffordshire</span><span class="c3 c0">, where he spent much of his time writing whilst on his visits. According to Tennyson, the poem represents &quot;young life, its good side, its deficiencies, and its yearnings&quot;. Each line follows a modified version of </span><span class="c0">trochaic octameter</span><span class="c3 c0">&nbsp;in which the last unstressed syllable has been eliminated; </span><span class="c0">University of Toronto</span><span class="c3 c0">&nbsp;library identifies this form as &quot;the old &#39;fifteener&#39; line,&quot; quoting Tennyson, who claimed it was written in trochaics because the father of his friend </span><span class="c0">Arthur Hallam</span><span class="c3 c0">&nbsp;suggested that the English liked the meter. The protagonist asks his friend to leave him alone as he starts to muse about his childhood upon reaching Locksley Hall where he has grown up. Then it becomes an interior monologue. Everything reminds him of his beloved who is now married. He bursts in anger and starts to feel she will forget him when she has a child. Then he crtitiques mother-child relationship. Finally, he seeks escape from these thoughts but asks what he should do. Then he turns his thoughts to a utopian future with marshals and navy.

Jane Welsh Carlyle, wife of Thomas Carlyle after reading the poem said she &quot;could not tell whether Sordello was &#39;a book, a city, or a man&#39;&quot;. Tennyson remarked: &quot;There were only two lines in it that I understood, and they were both lies; they were the opening and closing lines, &#39;Who will may hear Sordello&#39;s story told,&#39; and &#39;Who would has heard Sordello&#39;s story told!&#39;&quot;. Algernon Swinburne and Ezra Pound praised it. It&#39;s a fictionalised version of the life of Sordello da Goito, a 13th-century Lombard troubadour depicted in Canto VI of Dante Alighieri&#39;s </span><span class="c1 c0">Purgatorio</span><span class="c8 c3 c0">. The setting is northern Italy in the 1220s, dominated by the struggle between the Guelphs (partisans of the Pope) and the Ghibellines (partisans of the Holy Roman Emperor). Sordello is a Ghibelline. Beginns by him summoning the shades of all dead poets to listen to the story he has to tell, especially Shelley (whose name isn&rsquo;t said). The prince of Gulleps, Count Richard of St Boniface is captured by Taurello Salinguerra. The poet Sordillo starts to pine about Palma, his beloved. He ponders about his childhood when he was orphan page in the court and how he was enchanted by forests, castles caves etc. And he one day got to know of Palma and Richard&rsquo;s affair. He starts daydreaming. He wanders towards Mantua and hears an aged troubador Eglamor sing but performs poorly so he continues his performance and wins the prize and Palma&rsquo;s scarf. Eglamor dies the same night. Eglamor&#39;s jongleur, Naddo, becomes Sordello&#39;s jongleur. Upon learning about his origins, he finds his father was an archer who saved Adelaide and Palma from a fire set by lord Ecelin. He gives up the plan of becoming a &quot;man of action&quot;, and devotes himself to minstrelsy but grows bored. Thus, invents new language for his expression but encounters public incomprehension and personal fatigue. Sordello is deeply divided between his conceptions of poet as profession and poet as destiny. Ecelin II has resolved to retire to a monastery. Sordello is appointed to welcome Taurello with song, but the baffled troubadour, lacking inspiration, wanders back to Goito. Spends a year in daydreaming there and starts to see himself as a narcissist who ruined his career. Later, he&rsquo;s summoned to Verona to sing at Palma&#39;s wedding with Count Richard. He goes but she confesses her love for him and asks him to marry her. This would make him the head of the House of Romano; and Taurello consents to it. Ferrara is destroyed and Sordellois disgusted with both the Guelphs and the Ghibellines. He tells Palma his plans of building City of God in which Christendom can be reunited. Sordello has already concluded his dream is impracticable. He plans to convince Taurello to take up the Guelph cause and keep the Emperor away from Lombardy. It fails as his pride takes away his empathy. It&rsquo;s revealed that Sordello is Taurello&#39;s son, the child he thought had perished at Vicenza. Taurello begins his mad project to ignore both Emperor and Pope and build a new centre of power on the house of Romano. Sordello is torn between his affection for Guelphs and his being leader of Ghibellined. This chasm is deeper and he dies. Sordello&#39;s career is inflated by chroniclers and he is misremembered as a statesman and hero.

The play is in four acts and has only four main characters: Victor, Charles, Charles&#39;s wife Polyxena, and the minister D&#39;Ormea. Charles suffers from an inferiority complex. He has always been regarded as the dull son, forced into the role of heir after the death of his abler brother. The theme is the anxious and misguided loyalty of Charles to his father and his refusal to believe that he could have been deceived. Despite his disappointment, his virtuous behaviour finally leads to a reconciliation.</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c3 c0">3. </span><span class="c1 c6 c0">Dramatic Lyrics</span><span class="c3 c0">&nbsp;(1842) &ldquo;Marching Along&rdquo;, &ldquo;</span><span class="c6 c3 c0">Pied Piper of Hamelin&rdquo;</span><span class="c3 c0">&nbsp;1605 Verstegam version of story of rat-chaser who chases children. &quot;</span><span class="c6 c3 c0">My Last Duchess</span><span class="c3 c0">&quot;: in heroic couplet, earlier titled &quot;Italy&quot;.

The speaker is giving the emissary of the family of his prospective new wife a tour of the artworks in his home. She smiled on all; he had her killed and in the painting now she only smiles for him. Margaret Atwood&#39;s short story &quot;My Last Duchess&quot; appears in her short story anthology </span><span class="c1 c0">Moral Disorder</span><span class="c3 c0">&nbsp;(2006). It is about two high school students who study the poem and argue about its meaning. &quot;</span><span class="c6 c3 c0">Soliloquy of the Spanish Cloister</span><span class="c3 c0">&quot; : in trochaic tetrameter, the plot of the poem centers around the speaker&#39;s hatred for &quot;Brother Lawrence&quot;, a fellow monk in the cloister. The speaker notes the trivial ways in which Brother Lawrence fails in his Christianity, and then plots to murder, or damn the soul of, Brother Lawrence. However, the poem ends before the speaker can finish, when he is interrupted by the bells proclaiming it is time for vespers. &quot;</span><span class="c6 c3 c0">Porphyria&#39;s Lover</span><span class="c3 c0">&quot; (published under &quot;Madhouse Cells&quot; in 1842) first ever short dramatic monologue, possibly sourced from John Wilson&#39;s &quot;Extracts from Gosschen&#39;s Diary&quot;. In the poem, a man strangles his lover &ndash; Porphyria &ndash; with her hair; &quot;... and all her hair / In one long yellow string I wound / Three times her little throat around, / And strangled her.&quot; Porphyria&#39;s lover then talks of the corpse&#39;s blue eyes, golden hair, and describes the feelings of perfect happiness the murder gives him and his surprise at God&#39;s subsequent silence. Although he winds her hair around her throat three times to throttle her, the woman never cries out. The poem uses a somewhat unusual rhyme scheme: A,B,A,B,B, the final repetition bringing each stanza to a heavy rest. Opening: &ldquo;There&#39;s Heaven above, and night by night, / I look right through its gorgeous roof;&rdquo; Another poem under the title &quot;Madhouse Cells&quot; is </span><span class="c6 c3 c0">&quot;Johannes Agricola in Meditation&quot; </span><span class="c3 c0">which</span><span class="c6 c3 c0">&nbsp;is </span><span class="c3 c0">a critique of antinomianism.

Two of the riders&#39; horses collapse en route; the narrator alone makes it to Aix with the news, and rewards his horse with a drink of wine.

Opening: &ldquo;Where the quiet-coloured end of evening smiles, / Miles and miles&rdquo;. The speaker, overlooking a pasture where sheep graze, recalls that once a great ancient city, his country&#39;s capital, stood there. After spending four stanzas describing the beauty and grandeur of the ancient city, the speaker says that &quot;a girl with eager eyes and yellow hair/Waits me there&quot;, and that &quot;she looks now, breathless, dumb/Till I come.&quot; The speaker, after musing further on the glory of the city and thinking of how he will greet his lover, closes by rejecting the majesty of the old capital and preferring instead his love. &ldquo;</span><span class="c2 c3 c0">Evelyn Hope&rdquo;</span><span class="c7 c3 c0">&nbsp;&ldquo;</span><span class="c2 c1 c0">Fra Lippo Lippi</span><span class="c7 c3 c0">&rdquo;: depicts a 15th-century real-life painter, Filippo Lippi. The poem asks the question whether art should be true to life or an idealized image of life. The poem is written in blank verse, non-rhyming iambic pentameter. Also discusses Church&#39;s influence on art. Although Fra Lippo paints real life pictures, it is the Church that requires him to redo much of it, instructing him to paint the soul, not the flesh. &quot;</span><span class="c2 c3 c0">A Toccata of Galuppi&#39;s</span><span class="c7 c3 c0">&quot;: The title refers to the fact that the speaker is either playing or listening to a toccata by the 18th-century Venetian composer Baldassare Galuppi. </span><span class="c2 c3 c0">&quot;Andrea del Sarto&quot; </span><span class="c7 c3 c0">or &quot;The Faultless Painter&quot;: shows that Browning is trying to create art that allows for the body and the soul to both be portrayed rather than just the body or just the soul. In his poem, Browning cedes the paintings are free of errors, but that alone does not make a piece of art special or evocative. &quot;</span><span class="c2 c3 c0">Childe Roland to the Dark Tower Came</span><span class="c7 c3 c0">&quot; : The poem is often noted for its dark and atmospheric imagery, inversion of classical tropes, and use of unreliable narration. Childe Roland, the only speaker in the poem, describes his journey towards &quot;the Dark Tower&quot;, and his horror at what he sees on his quest. The poem ends when Roland finally reaches the tower, leaving his ultimate fate ambiguous.

Guido then appeals&mdash;unsuccessfully&mdash;to Pope Innocent XII to overturn the conviction.

In the prologue, the poet compares himself to the swimmer who exchanges the solid earth for the free medium of the sea, and, while he floats and meditates, sees above him a glorious butterfly, which has likewise changed its sphere of life from that of a worm on the ground to a denizen of the air. By a natural transition he extends the comparison to a departed soul, freed from the trammels of terrestrial life and transferred to a more elevated existence. In speculating upon those mutations, he professes that he &quot;both lives and likes life&#39;s way&quot;. Substituting poetry for heaven, he apostrophises a soul which has heaven for its home. There is also his wife Elvire.

L&eacute;once Miranda, the heir to a jewellery business, takes a mistress called Clara de Millefleurs, and houses her in a luxuriously renovated priory. Miranda&#39;s scandalised mother exacerbates his sense of guilt over this affair to such good effect that he tries to commit suicide by drowning himself in the Seine but fails. Later, he tries to break off and burn letters but mutilates himself by burning off both his hands. Continues relationship. Mother dies too which furthers his guilt. He dies by throwing himself from the belvedere of the priory as an act of faith, believing that he will be miraculously borne by the angels of the Virgin Mary to La Ravissante. His will, which divides his estate between the Church and Clara, is contested by his &quot;cousinry&quot;, who believe Miranda to have been insane when he made it, but the courts uphold the will, declaring Miranda&#39;s death to have been an accident.</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c1 c6 c0">Pacchiarotto, and How He Worked in Distemper</span><span class="c8 c3 c0">&nbsp;(1876) contains poems like: &ldquo;Of Pacchiarotto, and How He Worked in Distemper&rdquo;, &ldquo;Filippo Baldinucci on the Privilege of Burial&rdquo; &ldquo;Magical Nature&rdquo;, &ldquo;Natural Magic&rdquo; etc.</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c1 c0">The Agamemnon of Aeschylus</span><span class="c8 c3 c0">&nbsp;(1877)</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c1 c0">Dramatic Idyls</span><span class="c8 c3 c0">&nbsp;(1879)</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c1 c6 c0">Ferishtah&#39;s Fancies</span><span class="c3 c0">&nbsp;(1884) names taken from Ferdowsi&#39;s </span><span class="c1 c0">Sh&#257;hn&#257;meh</span><span class="c8 c3 c0">, but by and large the tales are Browning&#39;s invention.

If Shakespeare could sing with myriad lips, Browning could stammer through a thousand mouths. [...] Yes, Browning was great. And as what will he be remembered? As a poet? Ah, not as a poet! He will be remembered as a writer of fiction, as the most supreme writer of fiction, it may be, that we have ever had. His sense of dramatic situation was unrivalled, and, if he could not answer his own problems, he could at least put problems forth, and what more should an artist do? Considered from the point of view of a creator of character he ranks next to him who made Hamlet. Had he been articulate, he might have sat beside him. The only man who can touch the hem of his garment is George Meredith. Meredith is a prose Browning, and so is Browning.

It is a first-person narration, from the point of view of Aurora; its other heroine, Marian Erle, is an abused self-taught child of itinerant parents. In Books 1&ndash;5, Aurora narrates her past, from her childhood to the age of about 27; in Books 6&ndash;9, the narrative has caught up with her, and she reports events in diary form. John Ruskin called it the greatest long poem of the nineteenth century. Aurora describes her childhood in Florence when her mother dies at 4 and her father (English) at 14. Sent to Leigh Hall, her aunt, in England. There she reads Shakespeare&#39;s famous works and aspires to be a writer. Aunt&rsquo;s son Romney Leigh proposes for marriage and is rejected. She goes to London upon her aunt&rsquo;s death to become poet. There she publishes poems but cannot accomplish writing her beset work. Lady Waldemar who is in love with Romney comes to meet her. She asks her to convince Romney who does charity work and wants to marry a &ldquo;project&rdquo;, Marian Erle. They meet her and she tells them her mother sold her to prostitution and only Romney saved her. They all meet and Aurora approves of her. They decide to marry but on the day of wedding, Marian shys out and sends a letter stating she&rsquo;s no good for him. People attack Romney thinking he flirted with her. Here Rom. and Aur. are growing closer. She says &quot;Ay, but every age / Appears to souls who live in&#39;t (ask Carlyle) / Most unheroic&quot;. Two years pass and they haven&rsquo;t met. Hears that Waldemar is going to marry him. She has produced nothing. Decides to go to Italy for inspiration. At a stop-over in France she sees Marian and follows her. She has a child and explains that Waldemar sent her to France and said Romney didn&rsquo;t love her. Here she was raped and left pregnant. She proposes a sort of marriage to her and takes her to Italy, not informing Romney but writing fierce letter to Waldemar. The MS she sold to get to Italy has gained her success. Her presence reminds her more of Romney. Some years pass and Romney finally comes to visit them. He informs how the Leigh Hall was burnt to ground by some people thinking it was a prison. He hasn&rsquo;t married Waldemar and has a letter from her to Aurora which confirms how he loves Aurora instead of her.

Also made into choral work by Ralph Vaughan Williams. Arnold prefaces the poem with an extract from Glanvill, which tells the story of an impoverished Oxford student who left his studies to join a band of gipsies, and so ingratiated himself with them that they told him many of the secrets of their trade. After some time he was discovered and recognised by two of his former Oxford associates, who learned from him that the gipsies &quot;had a traditional kind of learning among them, and could do wonders by the power of imagination, their fancy binding that of others.&quot; When he had learned everything that the gipsies could teach him, he said, he would leave them and give an account of these secrets to the world.

They have a mohtly ritual wherein one member from Greek community and one from the wanderers tell one tale each. Thus, of the twenty-four stories, twelve are Greek and classical and twelve are medieval or romantic. The poem is divided into twelve sections, each section representing a </span><span class="c3 c0">month of the year and containing two tales told in verse, drawn largely from classical mythology or mediaeval legends, including the Icelandic sagas.

The novel describes a dream and time travel encounter between the medieval and modern worlds, thus contrasting the ethics of medieval and contemporary culture. A time-traveller tells Ball of the decline of feudalism and the rise of the Industrial Revolution. Ball realizes that in the nineteenth century his hopes for an egalitarian society have yet to be fulfilled. When Ball asks why his dreams of an egalitarian society have not come to pass, the narrator replies, &quot;Now I tell thee that in the days to come poor men shall be able to become lords and masters and do-nothings; and oft will it be seen that they shall do so; and it shall be even for that cause that their eyes shall be blinded to the robbing of themselves by others, because they shall hope in their souls that they may each live to rob others: and this shall be the very safeguard of all rule and law in those days.&rdquo; It has parallels with </span><span class="c1 c0">A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur&#39;s Court</span><span class="c8 c3 c0">&nbsp;(1889) by Mark Twain.</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c2 c1 c0">The Roots of the Mountains: Wherein is Told Somewhat of the Lives of the Men of Burgdale, Their Friends, Their Neighbours, Their Foemen, and Their Fellows in Arms</span><span class="c7 c3 c0">&nbsp;(1889) a fantasy romance novel, set in Burgdale, a small Germanic settlement in a valley at the foot of a mountain range</span><span class="c8 c3 c0">&nbsp;inhabited by the interdependent Dalemen.

The speaker deplores the ruin of his life, and in tones at times reminiscent of </span><span class="c7 c1 c0">Hamlet</span><span class="c7 c3 c0">, craves oblivion, for which the sea serves as a constant metaphor. First lines: &ldquo;Before our lives divide for ever, / While time is with us and hands are free,&rdquo;. &ldquo;</span><span class="c2 c3 c0">Hymn to Proserpine</span><span class="c7 c3 c0">&rdquo;: addressed to the goddess Proserpina, the Roman equivalent of Persephone, but laments the rise of Christianity for displacing the pagan goddess and her pantheon. The epigraph is the phrase </span><span class="c7 c1 c0">Vicisti, Galilaee</span><span class="c7 c3 c0">, Latin for &quot;You have conquered, O Galilean&quot;, the supposed dying words of the Emperor Julian who had tried to reverse the official endorsement of Christianity by the Roman Empire.

First line: &quot;Here, where the world is quiet&quot;. Some other lines: &quot;who gathers all things mortal; with cold immortal hands&quot; and &quot;Here life has death for neighbour&quot;. It brings up various questions commonly accompanying the Crisis of Faith of the Victorian era involving what happens after death. Swinburne was a strong advocate of aestheticism, and believed that art should be able to exist independently of political and moral ideologies. Swinburne once announced that his poetic theory &quot;insists upon the uninhibited exploration of all issues and experiences relevant to comprehensively prophetic treatment of the human condition&quot;. This poem celebrates the finality of death and the nothingness that lies beyond Persephone&#39;s welcoming arms, making a stark contrast to the beliefs of leading religions during this time. During his years as a journalist, John Morley famously described that Swinburne was always either &quot;the vindictive apostle of a crushing and iron shod despair or else the libidinous laureate of a pack of satyrs&quot; and that his poem &quot;The Garden of Proserpine&quot; displayed what kind of person Morley thought he was. &quot;</span><span class="c2 c3 c0">Dolores</span><span class="c7 c3 c0">: Notre-Dame des Sept Douleurs&rdquo; regards the figure of the titular &quot;Dolores, Our Lady of Pain&quot;. The speaker of the poem is the voice of a besotted lover, faced with, and lamenting, Swinburne&#39;s particular ruthless and grim representation of the sacred feminine, embodied here as the Lady of Pain. In these respects, the poem shares its central themes with &quot;Satia te Sanguine&quot; from the same 1866 collection, as does it similarly share its sadomasochistic imagery with that poem and many others within Swinburne&#39;s corpus. It conflates the cruel yet libidinous pagan goddess figure of Dolores, the Lady of Pain with Mary, Mother of Jesus and associates the poem itself, through its parenthetical titular text (</span><span class="c7 c1 c0">Notre-Dame des Sept Douleurs</span><span class="c7 c3 c0">, i.e., &quot;Our Lady of Seven Sorrows&quot;) with the Seven Dolours of the Virgin. It laments the passing of the worship of classical deities in favour of Christian morality: &ldquo;</span><span class="c7 c1 c0">What ailed us, O gods, to desert you | For creeds that refuse and restrain?&rdquo; </span><span class="c7 c3 c0">Arthur Clement Hilton parodied it in his poem &quot;Octopus&quot;, which substitutes the character of the Lady of Pain for that of the titular mollusk. Opens: &ldquo;</span><span class="c7 c1 c0">Cold eyelids that hide like a jewel | Hard eyes that grow soft for an hour</span><span class="c4 c3 c0">&quot;. &ldquo;The Sea-Swallows&rdquo;. Other poems like &quot;The Leper&quot;, &quot;Laus Veneris&quot;, and &quot;St Dorothy&quot; evoke a Victorian fascination with the Middle Ages and are in Medieval tone and style. Swinburne wrote in a wide variety of forms, including Sapphic stanzas (comprising 3 hendecasyllabic lines followed by an Adonic.</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c2 c1 c0">Songs before Sunrise</span><span class="c4 c3 c0">&nbsp;(1871) dedicated to his hero, Italian patriot Giuseppe Mazzini.

Two notable early poems from the collection (1860s) were &quot;Hap&quot; and &#39;Amabel&#39; - the latter exploring the theme of sexual attraction impacted by age taken up by The Well-Beloved. &#39;She at His Funeral&#39; was a tribute to Hardy&#39;s friend Horace Moule; while the bitter &quot;Neutral Tones&quot; and the cheerful &#39;Sergeant&#39;s Song&#39; show further aspects of Hardy&#39;s range of poetic subjects. The poem &ldquo;Neural Tones&rdquo; is famous: It is about the end of a relationship, and carries strong emotional appeal despite its &quot;neutral tones&quot;. Opening: &ldquo;We stood by a pond that winter day, / And the sun was white, as though chidden of God,&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c2 c1 c0">Poems of the Past and the Present</span><span class="c7 c3 c0">&nbsp;(1901) second collection. It is divided into five headings. The opening section is &ldquo;War Poems&rdquo; which deals with the treatment of the Boer War, especially one poem </span><span class="c7 c1 c0">Drummer Hodge. </span><span class="c7 c3 c0">In it also &quot;</span><span class="c2 c3 c0">The Darkling Thrush</span><span class="c7 c3 c0">&quot;: a poem about the turn of the century. Originally titled &quot;By the Century&#39;s Deathbed&quot;. The first two stanzas describe a bleak winter landscape at dusk, and the feeling of lifelessness that it produces. In stanza three, the melancholy atmosphere is transformed when &quot;an aged thrush, frail, gaunt, and small&quot; suddenly launches into &quot;a full-hearted evensong of joy illimited.&quot; The final stanza muses that since there was no apparent cause for such an ecstatic outburst, the bird&#39;s singing must have been inspired by &quot;some blessed Hope, whereof he knew and I was unaware.&quot; The use of the word &quot;darkling&quot; recalls the same word in Matthew Arnold&#39;s Dover Beach (1867), a poem about loss of faith. Opening: &ldquo;</span><span class="c7 c0 c39">I leant upon a coppice gate</span><span class="c7 c3 c0">&nbsp;/ When Frost was spectre-grey,&rdquo;. &quot;</span><span class="c2 c3 c0">The Ruined Maid</span><span class="c4 c3 c0">&quot; : a satirical poem about a woman who loses her purity or virginity during the Victorian Era, which is looked down upon. This poem displays how the ruined maid sees herself, but also how society sees her. It is in the form of a dialogue (couplets) between the ruined lady (&lsquo;Milia) and the working-class person (with a dialect). Amilia informs them: &quot;O didn&#39;t you know I&#39;d been ruined?&quot; said she. ***</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c7 c3 c0">&quot;</span><span class="c2 c3 c0">The Man He Killed</span><span class="c4 c3 c0">&quot; (1902) dramatises a battle scene between two men. He deals with an internal struggle as his thoughts are regretful before he even shoots. The narrator muses that, in a different context, he would have befriended the combatant. Nevertheless, he kills the man and attempts to reassure himself by explaining the reasons for shooting him. In the end, he has no real justifiable reason and wonders at how &quot;quaint and curious war is&quot; to make one kill a man as easily as becoming friends at an inn. Opening &ldquo;&#39;Had he and I but met / By some old ancient inn,&rdquo;.</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c2 c1 c0">The Dynasts</span><span class="c4 c3 c0">&nbsp;(1904 to 1908) in 3 parts, closet drama in verse and prose which Hardy considered as &quot;an epic-drama of the war with Napoleon, in three parts, nineteen acts and one hundred and thirty scenes&quot;. The three parts were published in 1904, 1906 and 1908. He described the work as &quot;the longest English drama in existence&quot;. George Orwell wrote that Hardy had &quot;set free his genius&quot; by writing this drama and thought its main appeal was &quot;in the grandiose and rather evil vision of armies marching and counter-marching through the mists, and men dying by hundreds of thousands in the Russian snows, and all for absolutely nothing.&quot; It opens with the time when Napoleon repeated his coronation ceremony at Milan and took up the crown of Lombardy, through January 1806, the time of the death of William Pitt the Younger. The principal historical events entail Napoleon&#39;s invasion plans for England, which are abandoned when French Admiral Pierre-Charles Villeneuve sails for the south, the Battle of Trafalgar, and subsequently the Battle of Ulm and the Battle of Austerlitz.</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c2 c1 c0">Time&#39;s Laughingstocks and Other Verses</span><span class="c7 c3 c0">&nbsp;(1909) in it, he considered </span><span class="c2 c3 c0">&quot;A Trampwoman&#39;s Tragedy&quot;</span><span class="c4 c3 c0">&nbsp;his most successful poem. The poem is about a trampwoman and her 3 companions, one her lover she calls her &quot;fancy man&quot;, a man named Jeering John with whom she flirts to tease her lover and an older lady named Mother Lee. She sits in John&rsquo;s lap to tease him and he tells her is the child his or John&rsquo;s. She just nods in ambiguity to tease him. He stabs John and is hanged later; she also has a miscarriage. Gilbert Murray thought &quot;He Abjures Love&quot; had a Horatian quality</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c2 c1 c0">Satires of Circumstance</span><span class="c7 c3 c0">&nbsp;(1914) in it: </span><span class="c2 c1 c0">Poems of 1912&ndash;1913</span><span class="c4 c3 c0">&nbsp;elegiac sequence in response to the death of his wife Emma. He wrote 15 poems named by the year of her death. &quot;After a Journey&quot;, &quot;The Voice&quot; are best in the collection. Claire Tomalin argues that Hardy became a truly great English poet after the death of his first wife Emma, and with these elegies he wrote &quot;the finest and strangest celebrations of the dead in English poetry.&quot; &quot;Without Ceremony,&quot; &quot;Beeny Cliff,&quot; and &quot;At Castle Boterel&quot;, together represent experiences that Hardy and Emma had shared prior to their marriage. Consequently, these poems are Hardy&#39;s memory of that earlier time, placed in connection with his recent loss. ***</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c4 c3 c0">&nbsp;&quot;Are You Digging on My Grave&quot;</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c7 c3 c0">&quot;</span><span class="c2 c3 c0">The Blinded Bird</span><span class="c4 c3 c0">&quot; (1916) The poem was reportedly written as a protest against Vinkensport, a sort of singing competition between male finches. The poem decries the prior historical practice of blinding birds to improve their performance at the sport.</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c2 c1 c0">Moments of Vision and Miscellaneous Verses</span><span class="c4 c3 c0">&nbsp;(1917) his largest poetic collection, contains section &#39;Poems of War and Patriotism&#39;. Poems like &quot;The Last Signal&quot;, on William Barnes, &quot;Logs on the Hearth&quot; about his recently deceased sister. Virginia Woolf took Hardy&#39;s phrase as a key to the occasions of heightened intensity that gave meaning to life: &quot;the year is marked by moments of great intensity. Hardy&#39;s &#39;moments of vision&#39;&quot;.</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c2 c1 c0">Late Lyrics and Earlier with Many Other Verses</span><span class="c4 c3 c0">&nbsp;(1922) attached an apology against charges of systematic pessimism, he maintained that his poetry was instead &ldquo;really a series of fugitive impressions which I have never tried to co-ordinate&rdquo;.</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c2 c1 c0">The Famous Tragedy of the Queen of Cornwall at Tintagel in Lyonnesse: A New Version of an Old Story, Arranged as a Play for Mummers in One Act, Requiring No Theatre or Scenery</span><span class="c4 c3 c0">&nbsp;(1923) verse tragedy based on mediaeval legend of Tristan and Iseult.</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c2 c1 c0">Human Shows, Far Phantasies, Songs and Trifles</span><span class="c4 c3 c0">&nbsp;(1925) most cheerful of Hardy&#39;s collections, he feared that he had been &ldquo;too liberal in selecting flippant, not to say farcical, pieces into the collection&rdquo;. A pastoral tone prevails, often dramatising characters from Hardy&#39;s fiction, and at times Hardy even seems to burlesque some of his own tragic themes - of ironic accidents and patterned fate &ndash; as in the sketch &quot;Snow in the Suburbs&quot;. &quot;Alike and Unalike&quot; records the beginning dissension in his marriage with his attachment to Florence Henniker; &quot;Nobody Comes&quot; records his lonely wait for his second wife Florence Dugdale to return after an operation in London.</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c2 c1 c0">Winter Words in Various Moods and Metres</span><span class="c4 c3 c0">&nbsp;(1928) the last, posthumous collection of poems . Notable autobiographical poems include &quot;A Private Man on Public Men&quot;, and &quot;So Various&quot;. The collection closes with the poet&#39;s final farewell: &quot;He Resolves to Say No More&quot;. </span></p><h2 class="c5 c19" id="h.8bm0hvjov3f8"><span class="c6">Alfred Edward Housman</span><span class="c14">&nbsp;(1859 to 1936)</span></h2><p class="c5"><span class="c4 c3 c0">&nbsp;one of the foremost classicists of his age.

In the poems, he poses as an unsophisticated and melancholy youth. Sales for it revived during the Second Boer War (1899&ndash;1902). The poems related to the feelings of young soldiers who read them in the trenches. For W. H. Auden and his generation &quot;no other poet seemed so perfectly to express the sensibility of a male adolescent&quot;. George Orwell said &quot;these were the poems which I and my contemporaries used to recite to ourselves, over and over, in a kind of ecstasy&quot;. The poem L opens: &ldquo;Clunton and Clunbury, / Clungunford and Clun, / Are the quietest places / Under the sun.&rdquo; Ezra Pound, whose &quot;Mr Housman&#39;s Message&quot; in his </span><span class="c7 c1 c0">Canzoni</span><span class="c4 c3 c0">&nbsp;(1911) is a parody of his style. Kingsley Amis wrote &quot;A.E.H.&quot; as more of &quot;an admiring imitation, not a parody,&quot;. He says &ldquo; chief sources of which I am conscious are Shakespeare&#39;s songs, the Scottish Border ballads, and Heine&quot;.</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c7 c3 c0">Wrote critical edition of Manilius&#39;s </span><span class="c7 c1 c0">Astronomicon</span><span class="c4 c3 c0">&nbsp;in five volumes between 1903 and 1930.</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c4 c3 c0">In his paper &quot;The Application of Thought to Textual Criticism&quot; (1921) he wrote: &quot;A textual critic engaged upon his business is not at all like Newton investigating the motion of the planets: he is much more like a dog hunting for fleas&quot;.</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c7 c1 c0">Epitaph on an Army of Mercenaries </span><span class="c4 c3 c0">honouring the British Expeditionary Force, an elite but small force of professional soldiers sent to Belgium at the start of the war.</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c2 c1 c0">Last Poems</span><span class="c7 c3 c0">&nbsp;(1922) contains 42 poems occasioned by his lifelong unrequited love Moses Jackson.

He explains &ldquo;</span><span class="c7 c1 c0">I publish these poems, few though they are, because it is not likely that I shall ever be impelled to write much more.

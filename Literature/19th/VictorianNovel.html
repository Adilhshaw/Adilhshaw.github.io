Nickleby. He befirnds Smike who at last turn out to be Ralp&rsquo;s son. Madeline Bray is loved by Nicholas, ; Hawks tries raping Kate; Nicholas works in theatre as Johnson (Romeo)&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c12"><span class="c14 c15">Newman Noggs, clerk of Ralph helps Nick. Ralph commits suicide as Smike dies of TB. and he is happy about that. Back to Devonshire all of these.&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c12"><span class="c14 c15">Nicholas Nickleby&#39;s father dies unexpectedly after losing all of his money in a poor investment. Nicholas, his mother and his younger sister, Kate, are forced to give up their comfortable lifestyle in Devonshire and travel to London to seek the aid of their only living relative, Nicholas&#39;s uncle, Ralph Nickleby. Ralph, a cold and ruthless businessman, has no desire to help his destitute relations and hates Nicholas at first sight because he reminds him of his dead brother. He gets Nicholas a very low-paying job as an assistant to Wackford Squeers, who runs the school Dotheboys Hall in Yorkshire. Nicholas is initially wary of Squeers (a very unpleasant man with one eye) because he is gruff and violent towards his young charges, but he tries to quell his suspicions. As Nicholas boards the stagecoach for Greta Bridge, he is handed a letter by Ralph&#39;s clerk, Newman Noggs. A once-wealthy businessman, Noggs lost his fortune, became a drunk, and had no other recourse but to seek employment with Ralph, whom he loathes. The letter expresses concern for him as an innocent young man and offers assistance if Nicholas ever requires it. Once he arrives in Yorkshire, Nicholas comes to realise that Squeers is running a scam: he takes in unwanted children (most of whom are orphaned, illegitimate, crippled or deformed) for a high fee, and starves and mistreats them while using the money sent by their parents, who only want to get them out of their way, to pad his own pockets. Squeers and his monstrous wife whip and beat the children regularly while spoiling their own children. Lessons are no better; they show how poorly educated Squeers himself is and he uses the lessons as excuses to send the boys off on chores. While he is there, Nicholas befriends a &quot;simple&quot; boy named Smike, who is older than the other &quot;students&quot; and now acts as an unpaid servant. Nicholas attracts the attention of Fanny Squeers, his employer&#39;s plain and shrewish daughter, who deludes herself into thinking that Nicholas is in love with her. She attempts to disclose her affections during a game of cards, but Nicholas doesn&#39;t catch her meaning. Instead, he ends up flirting with her friend Tilda Price, to the dismay and anger of both Fanny and Tilda&#39;s friendly but crude-mannered fianc&eacute; John Browdie.</span></p><p class="c12"><span class="c14 c15">After trying to get Nicholas&#39; attention by pretending to faint, Nicholas quickly sees through her ruse and bluntly tells her that he does not return her affections and he wishes to be free of the horrible atmosphere of Dotheboys Hall. Fanny is then embarrassed by his rejection, earning her hatred and bitterness towards him.</span></p><p class="c12"><span class="c14 c15">Fanny uses her new-found loathing of Nicholas to make life difficult for the only friend he has at the school: Smike, whom Squeers takes to beating more and more frequently. One day Smike runs away but is caught and brought back to Dotheboys. Squeers begins to flog him, but Nicholas intervenes. Enraged, Squeers strikes him across the face and Nicholas snaps, beating the schoolmaster violently. During the fight, Fanny steps in and attacks Nicholas, hating him for rejecting her love. Nicholas ignores her and goes on to beat Squeers bloody. Quickly packing his belongings and leaving Dotheboys Hall, he meets John Browdie on the way. Browdie finds the idea that Squeers himself has been beaten uproariously funny, and gives Nicholas money and a walking staff to aid him on his trip back to London. At dawn, he is found by Smike, who begs to come with him. Nicholas and Smike set out towards London. Among other things, Nicholas wants to find out what Squeers is going to tell his uncle.</span></p><p class="c12"><span class="c14 c15">Meanwhile, Kate and her mother are forced by Ralph to move out of their lodgings in the house of the kindly portrait painter Miss LaCreevy and into a cold and draughty house Ralph owns in a London slum. Ralph finds employment for Kate working for a fashionable milliner, Madame Mantalini. Her husband, Mr Mantalini, is a gigolo who depends on his (significantly older) wife to supply his extravagant tastes, and offends Kate by leering at her. Kate proves initially clumsy at her job, which endears her to the head of the showroom, Miss Knag, a vain and foolish woman who uses Kate to make herself look better. This backfires when a client prefers to be served by the young and pretty Kate rather than the ageing Miss Knag. Kate is blamed for the insult, and as a result, Kate is ostracised by the other milliners and left friendless.</span></p><p class="c12"><span class="c14 c15">Nicholas seeks out the aid of Newman Noggs, who shows him a letter that Fanny Squeers has written to Ralph. It viciously exaggerates the events of the beating and slanders Nicholas. They suspect Ralph secretly knows the truth but is latching onto Fanny&#39;s account to further persecute Nicholas. Noggs tells Nicholas, who is intent on confronting his uncle, that Ralph is out of town and advises him to find a job. Nicholas goes to an employment office, where he encounters a strikingly beautiful girl. His search for employment fails, and he is about to give up when Noggs offers him the meagre position of French teacher to the children of his neighbours, the Kenwigs family, and Nicholas is hired under the assumed name of &quot;Johnson&quot; to teach the children French.</span></p><p class="c12"><span class="c14 c15">Ralph asks Kate to attend a dinner he is hosting for some business associates. When she arrives she discovers she is the only woman in attendance, and it becomes clear Ralph is using her as bait to entice the foolish nobleman Lord Frederick Verisopht to do business with him. The other guests include Verisopht&#39;s mentor and friend, the disreputable nobleman Sir Mulberry Hawk, who humiliates Kate at dinner by making her the subject of an offensive bet (i.e., that she cannot look him in the eye and say that she does not want him to make love to her--NOTE: &quot;Make love&quot; did not mean sex in the novel, but rather to be romanced). She flees the table but is later accosted by Hawk. He attempts to force himself on her but is stopped by Ralph. Ralph shows some unexpected tenderness towards Kate but insinuates that he will withdraw his financial help if she tells her mother about what happened.</span></p><p class="c12"><span class="c14 c15">The next day, Nicholas discovers that his uncle has returned. He visits his mother and sister just as Ralph is reading them Fanny Squeers&#39; letter and slandering Nicholas. He confronts his uncle, who vows to give no financial assistance to the Nicklebys as long as Nicholas stays with them. His hand forced, Nicholas agrees to leave London but warns Ralph that a day of reckoning will one day come between them.</span></p><p class="c12"><span>The next morning, Nicholas and Smike travel towards Portsmouth with the intention of becoming sailors. At an inn, they encounter the theatrical manager Vincent Crummles, who hires Nicholas (still going under the name of Johnson) on sight. Nicholas is the new juvenile lead, and also playwright, with the task of adapting French tragedies into English and then modifying them for the troupe&#39;s minimal dramatic abilities. Nicholas and Smike join the acting company and are warmly received by the troupe, which includes Crummles&#39;s formidable wife, their daughter, &quot;The Infant Phenomenon&quot;, and many other eccentric and melodramatic thespians. Nicholas and Smike make their debuts in </span><span class="c2">Romeo and Juliet</span><span class="c14 c15">, as Romeo and the Apothecary respectively, and are met with great acclaim from the provincial audiences. Nicholas enjoys a flirtation with his Juliet, the lovely Miss Snevellici.</span></p><p class="c12"><span class="c14 c15">Back in London, Mr Mantalini&#39;s reckless spending has bankrupted his wife. Madame Mantalini is forced to sell her business to Miss Knag, whose first order of business is to fire Kate. She finds employment as the companion of the social-climbing Mrs Wittiterly. Meanwhile, Sir Mulberry Hawk begins a plot to humiliate Kate for refusing his advances. He uses Lord Frederick, who is infatuated with her, to discover where she lives from Ralph. He is about to succeed in this plot when Mrs. Nickleby enters Ralph&#39;s office, and the two rakes switch their attentions from Kate&#39;s uncle to her mother, successfully worming their way into Mrs Nickleby&#39;s company and gaining access to the Wittiterly house. Mrs. Wittiterly grows jealous and admonishes Kate for flirting with the noblemen. The unfairness of this accusation makes Kate so angry that she rebukes her employer, who flies into a fit of hysterics. With no other recourse, Kate goes to her uncle for assistance, but he refuses to help her, citing his business relationships with Hawk and Verisopht. It is left to Newman Noggs to come to her aid, and he writes to Nicholas, telling him in vague terms of his sister&#39;s urgent need of him. Nicholas immediately quits the Crummles troupe and returns to London.</span></p><p class="c12"><span class="c14 c15">Noggs and Miss LaCreevy confer and decide to delay telling Nicholas of Kate&#39;s plight until it is too late at night for him to seek out Hawk and take violent action. So, when Nicholas arrives, both Noggs and Miss La Creevy are out. Nicholas is about to search the city for them when he accidentally overhears Hawk and Lord Frederick rudely toasting Kate in a coffeehouse. He is able to glean from their conversation what has happened and confronts them. Hawk refuses to give Nicholas his name or respond to his accusations. When he attempts to leave, Nicholas follows him out, and leaps onto the running board of his carriage, demanding his name. Hawk strikes him with a riding crop, and Nicholas loses his temper, returning the blow and spooking the horses, causing the carriage to crash. Hawk is injured in the crash and vows revenge, but Lord Verisopht, remorseful for his treatment of Kate, tells him that he will attempt to stop him. Later, after Hawk has recovered, they quarrel over Hawk&#39;s insistence on revenging himself against Nicholas. Verisopht strikes Hawk, resulting in a duel. Verisopht is killed, and Hawk flees to France. As a result, Ralph loses a large sum of money owed to him by the deceased lord.</span></p><p class="c12"><span class="c14 c15">Nicholas collects Kate from the Wittiterlys, and with their mother and Smike, they move back into Miss LaCreevy&#39;s house. Nicholas pens a letter to Ralph, refusing, on behalf of his family, a penny of his uncle&#39;s money or influence. Returning to the employment office, Nicholas meets Charles Cheeryble, a wealthy and extremely benevolent merchant who runs a business with his twin brother Ned. Hearing Nicholas&#39;s story, the brothers take him into their employ at a generous salary and provide his family with a small house in a London suburb.</span></p><p class="c12"><span class="c14 c15">Ralph encounters a beggar, who recognises him and reveals himself as Brooker, Ralph&#39;s former employee. He attempts to blackmail Ralph with a piece of unknown information but is driven off. Returning to his office, Ralph receives Nicholas&#39;s letter and begins plotting against his nephew in earnest. Wackford Squeers returns to London and joins Ralph in his plots.</span></p><p class="c12"><span class="c14 c15">Smike, on a London street, has the misfortune to run into Squeers, who kidnaps him. Luckily for Smike, John Browdie is honeymooning in London with his new wife Tilda and discovers his predicament. When they have dinner with Squeers, Browdie fakes an illness and takes the opportunity to rescue Smike and send him back to Nicholas. In gratitude, Nicholas invites the Browdies to dinner. At the party, also attended by the Cheerybles&#39; nephew Frank and their elderly clerk Tim Linkinwater, Ralph and Squeers attempt to reclaim Smike by presenting forged documents to the effect that he is the long-lost son of a man named Snawley (who, in actuality, is a friend of Squeers with children at Dotheboys Hall). Smike refuses to go, but the threat of legal action remains.</span></p><p class="c12"><span class="c14 c15">While at work, Nicholas encounters the beautiful young woman he had seen in the employment office and realises he is in love with her. The brothers tell him that her name is Madeline Bray, the penniless daughter of a debtor, Walter Bray, and enlist his help in obtaining small sums of money for her by commissioning her artwork, the only way they can help her due to her tyrannical father.</span></p><p class="c12"><span class="c14 c15">Arthur Gride, an elderly miser, offers to pay a debt Ralph is owed by Walter Bray in exchange for the moneylender&#39;s help. Gride has illegally gained possession of the will of Madeline&#39;s grandfather, and she will become an heiress upon the event of her marriage. The two moneylenders persuade Bray to bully his daughter into accepting the disgusting Gride as a husband, with the promise of paying off his debts. Ralph is not aware of Nicholas&#39;s involvement with the Brays, and Nicholas does not discover Ralph&#39;s scheme until the eve of the wedding. He appeals to Madeline to cancel the wedding, but despite her feelings for Nicholas, she is too devoted to her dying father to go against his wishes. On the day of the wedding, Nicholas attempts to stop it once more but his efforts prove academic when Bray, guilt-ridden at the sacrifice his daughter has made for him, dies unexpectedly. Madeline thus has no reason to marry Gride and Nicholas and Kate take her to their house to recover.</span></p><p class="c12"><span class="c14 c15">Smike has contracted tuberculosis and become dangerously ill. In a last attempt to save his friend&#39;s health, Nicholas takes him to his childhood home in Devonshire, but Smike&#39;s health rapidly deteriorates. On his deathbed, Smike is startled to see the man who brought him to Squeers&#39;s school. Nicholas dismisses it as an illusion but it is later revealed that Smike was right. After confessing his love for Kate, Smike dies peacefully in Nicholas&#39;s arms.</span></p><p class="c12"><span class="c14 c15">When they return to Gride&#39;s home after the aborted wedding, Ralph and Gride discover that Peg Sliderskew, Gride&#39;s aged housekeeper, has robbed Gride, taking, amongst other things, the will. To get it back, Ralph enlists Wackford Squeers&#39;s services to track down Peg. Noggs discovers this plot, and with the help of Frank Cheeryble, he is able to recover the will and have Squeers arrested.</span></p><p class="c12"><span class="c14 c15">The Cheeryble brothers confront Ralph, informing him that his various schemes against Nicholas have failed. They advise him to retire from London before charges are brought up against him, as Squeers is determined to confess all and implicate Ralph. He refuses their help but is summoned back to their offices that evening and told that Smike is dead. When he reacts to the news with vicious glee, the brothers reveal their final card. The beggar Brooker emerges and tells Ralph that Smike was his son. As a young man, Ralph had married a woman for her fortune but kept it secret so she would not forfeit her inheritance for marrying without her brother&#39;s consent, and wait for the brother to die. She eventually left him after bearing him a son, whom he entrusted to Brooker, who was then his clerk. Brooker, taking the opportunity for vengeance, took the boy to Squeers&#39; school and told Ralph the boy had died. Brooker now repents his action, but a transportation sentence kept him from putting the matter right. Devastated at the thought that his only son died as the best friend of his greatest enemy, Ralph commits suicide. His ill-gotten fortune ends up in the state coffers because he died intestate and his estranged relatives decline to claim it.</span></p><p class="c12"><span class="c14 c15">Squeers is sentenced to transportation to Australia, and, upon hearing this, the boys at Dotheboys Hall rebel against the Squeers family and escape with the assistance of John Browdie. Nicholas becomes a partner in the Cheerybles&#39; firm and marries Madeline. Kate and Frank Cheeryble also marry, as do Tim Linkinwater and Miss LaCreevy. Brooker dies penitent. Noggs recovers his respectability. The Nicklebys and their now extended family return to Devonshire, where they live in peace and contentment and grieve over Smike&#39;s grave.</span></p><p class="c12"><span class="c2 c7">Oliver Twist; or, The Parish Boy&#39;s Progress </span><span class="c7">(1837-39, 3 vol.)</span></p><p class="c12"><span>The alternative title, </span><span class="c2">The Parish Boy&#39;s Progress</span><span>, alludes to Bunyan&#39;s </span><span class="c2">The Pilgrim&#39;s Progress</span><span>, as well as the 18th-century caricature series by painter William Hogarth, </span><span class="c2">A Rake&#39;s Progress</span><span>&nbsp;and </span><span class="c2">A Harlot&#39;s Progress</span><span class="c14 c15">.</span></p><p class="c12"><span class="c14 c15">Oliver Twist is born into a life of poverty and misfortune, raised in a workhouse in the fictional town of Mudfog. The children working there receive very little food; after six months, they draw lots, with the loser asking for another portion of gruel. Oliver is designated, and so he approaches workhouse manager Mr. Bumble and humbly requests another serving. A great uproar ensues at this perceived act of rebellion.</span></p><p class="c12"><span class="c14 c15">Oliver is removed from the workhouse and sent into the service of undertaker Mr. Sowerberry. One day, jealous co-apprentice Noah Claypole insults Oliver&#39;s mother and an enraged physical altercation ensues. Oliver runs away to London to seek a better life.</span></p><p class="c12"><span class="c14 c15">Oliver meets a young man named Jack Dawkins who calls himself &quot;the Artful Dodger&quot;, offers him food and lodging and takes him to meet an infamous criminal known as Fagin, who trains orphan boys as pickpockets. Oliver innocently begins Fagin&#39;s training, but when he goes out with the Dodger and another boy and sees them stealing a handkerchief from an old gentleman named Mr. Brownlow, he realizes the truth. While the Dodger and the other boy escape, Oliver is pursued, apprehended, formally arrested and tried before Magistrate Fang. Interceding for Oliver, Brownlow takes him home and cares for him. As Oliver recovers, Brownlow and his housekeeper notice that Oliver resembles a woman depicted in a portrait hanging in Brownlow&#39;s home.</span></p><p class="c12"><span class="c14 c15">Worried that Oliver might incriminate him and his gang, Fagin sends a young woman named Nancy and her abusive lover, the robber Bill Sikes, to abduct Oliver and bring him back to Fagin&#39;s lair. Fagin forces him to participate in a burglary planned by Sikes. The robbery goes wrong; while Sikes escapes, Oliver, after having been wounded, ends up in the care of the people he was supposed to rob: Miss Rose and her guardian Mrs. Maylie.</span></p><p class="c12"><span class="c14 c15">A mysterious man, known only as &quot;Monks,&quot; teams up with Fagin, to prevent Oliver from learning of his past. Monks bribes Mr. Bumble and his new wife, the former Widow Corney, for information on Oliver. Together, they dispose of a ring and medallion that had once belonged to Oliver&#39;s mother and had been stolen from her after she died. Nancy, racked with guilt for her role in Oliver&#39;s kidnapping, secretly spies on them and passes the information on to Rose Maylie, who tells Mr. Brownlow. Meanwhile, the Artful Dodger is arrested for pickpocketing, tried and sentenced to Transportation to Australia.</span></p><p class="c12"><span class="c14 c15">Noah Claypole, who had fled to London with the Sowerberry&#39;s maid Charlotte after robbing Mr. Sowerberry, joins Fagin&#39;s gang. Following Fagin&#39;s orders, he follows Nancy and discovers that she regularly meets with the Brownlows and Maylies for the sake of Oliver&#39;s welfare. Fearing that Nancy has betrayed him and Sikes (which, unknown to him, she has refused to do), Fagin passes the information on to Sikes, who beats Nancy to death in a fit of rage and goes into hiding. He is recognized by an angry mob and attempts to flee. Going to Fagin&#39;s hideout, he learns that Fagin has been arrested. When the mob catches up to him, he tries to escape over the rooftops by swinging on a rope, but while he is about to loop the rope about himself a vision of the dead Nancy&#39;s staring eyes terrorizes him into losing his balance; in the fall, the looped rope catches him around the neck and hangs him.</span></p><p class="c12"><span class="c14 c15">Mr. Brownlow has Monks arrested and forces him to divulge his secrets: he is actually Oliver&#39;s half-brother and had hoped to steal Oliver&#39;s half of their rightful inheritance. Brownlow begs Oliver to give half his inheritance to Monks and grant him a second chance, to which Oliver happily agrees. Monks emigrates to America, but squanders his money, relapses into crime and dies in prison. Fagin is arrested and sentenced to the gallows. The day before his execution, Oliver and Mr. Brownlow visit him in Newgate Prison and learn the location of the documents proving Oliver&#39;s identity. Bumble and his wife lose their jobs and are forced to become inmates of the workhouse. Rose Maylie, who turns out to be Oliver&#39;s maternal aunt, marries and enjoys a long life. Oliver lives happily with Mr. Brownlow as his adopted son.</span></p><p class="c12 c23"><span class="c14 c15"></span></p><p class="c12"><span class="c2 c7">Old Curiosity Shop </span><span class="c7">(1840-41)</span><span class="c14 c15">&nbsp;Serialised in Master Humphrey&#39;s Clock.</span></p><p class="c12"><span class="c14 c15">Narrates events taking pace in 1825 (Death of Byron in 1824 referred to by Mrs Monflathers )</span></p><p class="c12"><span class="c14 c15">The Old Curiosity Shop tells the story of Nell Trent, a beautiful and virtuous young girl of &quot;not quite fourteen&quot;. An orphan, she lives with her maternal grandfather (whose name is never revealed) in his shop of odds and ends. Her grandfather loves her dearly, and Nell does not complain, but she lives a lonely existence with almost no friends her own age. Her only friend is Kit, an honest boy employed at the shop, whom she is teaching to write. Secretly obsessed with ensuring that Nell does not die in poverty as her parents did, her grandfather attempts to provide Nell with a good inheritance through gambling at cards. He keeps his nocturnal games a secret, but borrows heavily from the evil Daniel Quilp, a malicious, grotesquely deformed, hunchbacked dwarf moneylender. In the end, he gambles away what little money they have, and Quilp seizes the opportunity to take possession of the shop and evict Nell and her grandfather. Her grandfather suffers a breakdown that leaves him bereft of his wits, and Nell takes him away to the Midlands of England, to live as beggars.</span></p><p class="c12 c23"><span class="c14 c15"></span></p><p class="c12"><span class="c14 c15">Convinced that the old man has stored up a large and prosperous fortune for Nell, her wastrel older brother, Frederick, convinces the good-natured but easily led Dick Swiveller to help him track Nell down, so that Swiveller can marry Nell and share her supposed inheritance with Frederick. To this end, they join forces with Quilp, who knows full well that there is no fortune, but sadistically chooses to &#39;help&#39; them to enjoy the misery it will inflict on all concerned. Quilp begins to try to track Nell down, but the fugitives are not easily discovered. To keep Dick Swiveller under his eye, Quilp arranges for him to be taken as a clerk by Quilp&#39;s lawyer, Mr. Brass. At the Brass firm, Dick befriends the mistreated maidservant and nicknames her &#39;the Marchioness&#39;. Nell, having fallen in with a number of characters, some villainous and some kind, succeeds in leading her grandfather to safety in a far-off village (identified by Dickens as Tong, Shropshire), but this comes at a considerable cost to Nell&#39;s health.</span></p><p class="c12 c23"><span class="c14 c15"></span></p><p class="c12"><span class="c14 c15">Meanwhile, Kit, having lost his job at the curiosity shop, has found new employment with the kind Mr and Mrs Garland. Here he is contacted by a mysterious &#39;single gentleman&#39; who is looking for news of Nell and her grandfather. The &#39;single gentleman&#39; and Kit&#39;s mother go after them unsuccessfully, and encounter Quilp, who is also hunting for the runaways. Quilp forms a grudge against Kit and has him framed as a thief. Kit is sentenced to transportation. However, Dick Swiveller proves Kit&#39;s innocence with the help of his friend the Marchioness. Quilp is hunted down and dies trying to escape his pursuers.

David was born in Blunderstone, Suffolk, England, six months after the death of his father. David spends his early years in relative happiness with his loving, childish mother and their kindly housekeeper, Clara Peggotty. They call him Davy. When he is seven years old his mother marries Edward Murdstone without having told him they plan to marry. To get him out of the way, David is sent to visit with Peggotty&#39;s family in Yarmouth. Her brother, fisherman Mr Peggotty, lives in a beached barge, with his adopted niece and nephew Emily and Ham, and an elderly widow, Mrs Gummidge. &quot;Little Em&#39;ly&quot; is somewhat spoiled by her fond foster father, and David is in love with her. They call him Master Copperfield.</span></p><p class="c12"><span class="c14 c15">On his return, David discovers his mother has married and is immediately given good reason to dislike his stepfather, Murdstone, who believes exclusively in stern, even harsh, methods of parenting, calling it &quot;firmness&quot;. David has similar feelings for Murdstone&#39;s sister Jane, who moves into the house soon afterwards. Between them they tyrannise his poor mother, making her and David&#39;s lives miserable, and when, in consequence, David falls behind in his studies, Murdstone attempts to thrash him &ndash; partly to further pain his mother. David bites him and soon afterwards is sent away to Salem House, a boarding school, under a ruthless headmaster named Mr Creakle. There he is befriended by an older boy, James Steerforth, and Tommy Traddles. He develops an impassioned admiration for Steerforth, perceiving him as someone noble, who could do great things if he would, and one who pays attention to him.</span></p><p class="c12"><span class="c14 c15">David goes home for the holidays to learn that his mother has given birth to a baby boy. Shortly after David returns to Salem House, his mother and her baby die, and David returns home immediately. Peggotty marries the local carrier, Mr Barkis. Murdstone sends David to work for a wine merchant in London &ndash; a business of which Murdstone is a joint owner. After some months, David&#39;s friendly but spendthrift landlord, Wilkins Micawber, is arrested for debt and sent to the King&#39;s Bench Prison. On one of David&#39;s visits, Micawber advises David to head to Dover to find his only known remaining relative, his eccentric and kind-hearted great-aunt Betsey Trotwood. After Micawber is released and has moved to Plymouth, no one in London cares about David, so he decides to run away to his aunt. She had come to Blunderstone at his birth, only to depart in ire upon learning that he was not a girl. However, she takes it upon herself to raise David, despite Murdstone&#39;s attempt to regain custody of him. She encourages him to &#39;be as like his sister, Betsey Trotwood&#39; as he can be &ndash; that is, to meet the expectations she had for the girl who was never born. David&#39;s great-aunt renames him &quot;Trotwood Copperfield&quot; and addresses him as &quot;Trot&quot;, one of several names others call David in the novel.</span></p><p class="c12"><span class="c14 c15">David&#39;s aunt sends him to a better school than the last he attended. It is run by kind Dr. Strong, whose methods inculcate honour and self-reliance in his pupils.

Wickfield&#39;s clerk, Uriah Heep, also lives at the house.</span></p><p class="c12"><span class="c14 c15">By devious means, Uriah Heep gradually gains a complete ascendancy over the aging and alcoholic Wickfield, to Agnes&#39;s great sorrow. Heep, as he maliciously confides to David, aspires to marry Agnes. Ultimately with the aid of Micawber, who has been employed by Heep as a secretary, his fraudulent behaviour is revealed. (At the end of the book, David encounters him in prison, convicted of attempting to defraud the Bank of England.)</span></p><p class="c12"><span class="c14 c15">After completing school, David apprentices to be a proctor. During this time, due to Heep&#39;s fraudulent activities, his aunt&#39;s fortune has diminished. David toils to make a living. He works mornings and evenings for his former teacher Dr Strong as a secretary, and also starts to learn shorthand, with the help of his old school-friend Traddles, upon completion reporting parliamentary debate for a newspaper. With considerable moral support from Agnes and his own great diligence and hard work, David ultimately finds fame and fortune as an author, writing fiction.</span></p><p class="c12"><span class="c14 c15">David&#39;s romantic but self-serving school friend, Steerforth, also re-acquainted with David, goes on to seduce and dishonour Emily, offering to marry her off to his manservant Littimer before deserting her in Europe. Her uncle Mr Peggotty manages to find her with the help of Martha, who had grown up in their part of England and then settled in London. Ham, who had been engaged to marry Emily before the tragedy, dies in a fierce storm off the coast in attempting to succour a ship. Steerforth was aboard the ship and also dies. Mr Peggotty takes Emily to a new life in Australia, accompanied by Mrs Gummidge and the Micawbers, where all eventually find security and happiness.</span></p><p class="c12"><span class="c14 c15">David, meanwhile, has fallen completely in love with Dora Spenlow, and then marries her.

While living in Switzerland to dispel his grief over so many losses, David realises that he loves Agnes.

David and Agnes then have at least five children, including a daughter named after his great-aunt, Betsey Trotwood.</span></p><p class="c12"><span class="c2 c7">Bleak House </span><span>(1852 to 53) a complex and darkly satirical exploration of the British legal system and the devastating effects it can have on people&#39;s lives. The novel follows two intertwined stories, both connected to a never-ending legal case known as </span><span class="c2">Jarndyce and Jarndyce</span><span>, which revolves around a contested will and has dragged on for generations. The case has ensnared numerous individuals in its labyrinthine procedures, consuming their time, money, and even lives. The story is narrated in part by Esther Summerson, a compassionate and modest young woman with mysterious parentage, who lives with her guardian, John Jarndyce, at his home, Bleak House. Esther is central to the story&rsquo;s heart, bringing kindness and stability to those around her, even as she learns of her own tragic past and the secrets tied to her birth. Alongside Esther&#39;s narrative, Dickens uses an omniscient narrator to depict other characters and subplots, each illustrating the corruption, misery, and absurdity of the Chancery Court. These include Lady Dedlock, a beautiful and melancholic aristocrat with a dark secret, and Inspector Bucket, one of literature&#39;s first detectives, who investigates a murder and uncovers hidden connections between the characters. As the plot unfolds, it reveals that Lady Dedlock is Esther&rsquo;s mother, a fact hidden to protect her social status. Tragedy strikes when Lady Dedlock&#39;s secret is exposed, leading her to flee and ultimately perish in a snowstorm, while Inspector Bucket tirelessly pursues justice in his investigation. Meanwhile</span><span class="c2">, Jarndyce and Jarndyce</span><span class="c14 c15">&nbsp;drags on until the court case finally ends, not because a verdict is reached, but because the entire estate has been consumed by legal fees&mdash;an ironic and scathing comment on the futility and cruelty of the Chancery system.</span></p><p class="c12 c23"><span class="c14 c15"></span></p><p class="c12"><span class="c2 c7">Hard Times: For These Times </span><span class="c14 c15">(1854)</span></p><p class="c12"><span class="c14 c15">Set in Victorian industrial Coketown; Book I is entitled &quot;Sowing&quot;, Book II is entitled &quot;Reaping&quot;, and the third is &quot;Garnering.&quot;</span></p><p class="c12"><span class="c2 c7">Little Dorrit </span><span class="c14 c15">(1855 to 57)</span></p><p class="c20"><span class="c14 c15">The story centres around Amy Dorrit, known as &quot;Little Dorrit&quot; because of her small stature and meek, gentle nature, and her life within the Marshalsea debtors&rsquo; prison, where she was born. Amy&rsquo;s father, William Dorrit, has been imprisoned in the Marshalsea for years due to a large debt he&rsquo;s unable to pay. Though poor and humble, Amy works tirelessly as a seamstress and cares for her father and siblings, maintaining a spirit of kindness and humility even under the harshest conditions. The family&rsquo;s life begins to change when Arthur Clennam, a man recently returned from a business venture abroad, becomes interested in Amy&rsquo;s story. Arthur suspects that his own family may have played a part in the Dorrits&rsquo; misfortune, as he remembers a mysterious message his dying father left, urging him to &ldquo;put things right.&rdquo; Drawn by a sense of responsibility, Arthur investigates and befriends Amy, offering her support and kindness. In a twist of fate, it is discovered that William Dorrit is actually the heir to a large fortune. The Dorrit family is suddenly released from the prison, and they move into high society, where they are treated with great respect and admiration. However, wealth does not bring the happiness the Dorrits had hoped for. William Dorrit, once hardened by his years in prison, becomes increasingly arrogant and obsessed with status, and he eventually dies, still haunted by his time in the Marshalsea. Amy remains humble and compassionate despite her change in circumstances and continues to care for Arthur, even as he himself faces financial troubles. As Arthur delves deeper into the corruption within the British financial world, he becomes involved with Mr. Merdle, a financier with a seemingly impeccable reputation. Merdle&rsquo;s scheme ultimately collapses, revealing that his wealth was built on fraudulent investments, which leaves Arthur in financial ruin. He ends up imprisoned in the Marshalsea, the same prison where the Dorrits once lived. In the novel&rsquo;s conclusion, Amy&rsquo;s love and kindness help Arthur through his dark times, and eventually, they marry. </span></p><p class="c12 c23"><span class="c14 c15"></span></p><p class="c12"><span class="c2 c7">Great Expectations</span><span class="c14 c15">&nbsp;(1860-61) the coming-of-age story of an orphan named Pip and explores themes of ambition, social class, love, and redemption. Set in Victorian England, the novel opens with young Pip being raised by his harsh sister and her kind husband, Joe Gargery, a blacksmith. One day, Pip has a terrifying encounter with an escaped convict, Magwitch, whom he helps out of fear and pity by providing him with food and a file to remove his shackles. Soon after, Pip is invited to the home of the wealthy but eccentric Miss Havisham, who lives in a decaying mansion and wears an old wedding dress. Miss Havisham was abandoned by her fianc&eacute; on her wedding day and has raised her adopted daughter, Estella, to break men&rsquo;s hearts as revenge against men. Pip quickly becomes infatuated with the beautiful but cold Estella and begins to dream of rising above his social class to win her love. Pip&rsquo;s life changes dramatically when he is informed by a lawyer, Mr. Jaggers, that he has come into a large fortune from an anonymous benefactor. Believing that Miss Havisham is his benefactor and that she intends for him to marry Estella, Pip moves to London to become a &quot;gentleman&quot; and leaves behind his humble roots and his loyal friend, Joe. As Pip adjusts to his new life, he becomes increasingly ashamed of his origins and grows distant from those who love him most. However, Pip&rsquo;s world is turned upside down when he learns that his true benefactor is not Miss Havisham, but Magwitch, the convict he helped as a child. Magwitch, who had become wealthy in Australia, was grateful to Pip and wanted to make him a gentleman as a gesture of gratitude. Pip is horrified at first but comes to see Magwitch as a father figure and helps him hide from the law. As Pip&rsquo;s illusions are shattered, he realizes that his wealth and social ambitions have alienated him from the people who cared for him. In an attempt to help Magwitch escape from England, Pip is confronted by Magwitch&rsquo;s old enemy, Compeyson, who had swindled Miss Havisham and left her at the altar. In a dramatic scene, Magwitch is captured, and Pip loses his fortune when it is forfeited to the state. In the end, Pip is left penniless and humbled. He reconciles with Joe and Biddy, who have married each other, and learns the value of loyalty and integrity. In some versions of the novel&rsquo;s ending, Pip and Estella meet years later and part as friends, suggesting that they have both found peace with their pasts.</span></p><p class="c12"><span class="c2 c7">Our Mutual Friend </span><span class="c14 c15">(1864 to 65) the story examines how wealth can corrupt and shape people&rsquo;s lives and how genuine human relationships can often be obscured by material desires. The novel opens with the mysterious death of John Harmon, who was set to inherit a vast fortune from his estranged father. The Harmon fortune was made in the dust and garbage business, and the family&#39;s wealth is entangled with the refuse and decay of the city. Harmon&rsquo;s body is found in the Thames River, and his inheritance falls to Mr. and Mrs. Boffin, a kindly but unrefined couple who had served as his father&rsquo;s servants. However, he has faked his death to observe the people around him and see if they cared for him or his fortune. Under the alias &quot;John Rokesmith,&quot; Harmon takes a job as Mr. Boffin&rsquo;s secretary and watches how his inheritance affects those around him. He becomes close to Bella Wilfer, a young woman from a modest background who had been expected to marry him before his &ldquo;death&rdquo; in order to secure her financial future. Though Bella initially seeks wealth and status, she gradually learns to value love and integrity more than riches and begins to fall in love with Rokesmith, unaware of his true identity. Meanwhile, Mr. Boffin, encouraged by the greedy and manipulative Mr. Silas Wegg, adopts a fa&ccedil;ade of miserliness to test Bella&#39;s sincerity. &nbsp;The novel includes a number of subplots, one of the most notable involving the relationship between Lizzie Hexam, the daughter of a river scavenger, and Eugene Wrayburn, a wealthy lawyer. Eugene is initially drawn to Lizzie out of fascination, but he gradually falls genuinely in love with her. His rival, Bradley Headstone, a schoolteacher with an obsessive love for Lizzie, is consumed by jealousy and rage, leading him to commit violent acts in his pursuit of her. Lizzie&rsquo;s kindness, strength, and courage make her one of the novel&#39;s moral anchors, and her relationship with Eugene becomes a tale of redemption and transformation. In the end, John Harmon reveals his true identity, and he and Bella marry, having come to appreciate the value of love over money. The Boffins are restored to their kindly, generous selves, and Wegg&rsquo;s schemes are thwarted. Eugene and Lizzie, too, find happiness, despite their differences in class, suggesting that true love can transcend social barriers.</span></p><p class="c12"><span class="c2 c7">A Tale of Two Cities</span><span>&nbsp;Published to launch </span><span class="c2">All Year Round. </span><span class="c14 c15">(1859) historical novel, French revolution.</span></p><p class="c12"><span class="c14 c15">Book the First: Recalled to Life (book title refers to Jarvis Lorry&rsquo;s message, a bank manager)&nbsp; Alexandre Manette, Frenchtor released after 18 years from Bastille; Lucie Manette is daughter;</span></p><p class="c12"><span class="c14 c15">Book the Second: The Golden Thread.

Raised in the countryside by his doting mother and guided by his uncle, Major Pendennis, Arthur aspires to make his mark on the world. The narrative follows his experiences from his youth to early adulthood, focusing on his education, his romantic entanglements, and his aspirations as a writer. He lives with his foster sister Laura whom his mother intended him to marry. Arthur&#39;s first love is with Miss Fotheringay, an actress, which ends in heartbreak as they get to know he isn&rsquo;t rich. He then enters the University of Oxbridge where he squanders opportunities and accumulates debts while attempting to project the image of a fashionable young man. His lack of discipline and focus leads to his eventual withdrawal from university. As Arthur matures, he pursues a career in journalism. He experiences a series of friendships and rivalries, most notably with George Warrington, his steadfast and moral companion, and the scheming Foker, a comedic yet insightful foil. The neighbours Claverings come back to London and he becomes infatuated with Blanche Amory and he starts to flirt with her. Colonel Altamont threatens Sir Francis Claverings with the fact that he actually is the first husband (still living) of his wife. Later Pen and another lower-class girl Fanny get closer but Helen (his mother) thwarts his plans of marrying her. In the end he is engaged to Blanche who breaks the engagement as she is proposed by the richer Harry Foker.

Regarded her best work and one of the great English novels. It was a result of two works: the novel &quot;</span><span class="c2 c3">Middlemarch</span><span class="c3">&quot; (which focused on the character of Lydgate, she explains this was a subject that she had considered &quot;ever since I began to write fiction&quot;) and the long story &quot;Miss Brooke&quot; (which focused on the character of Dorothea). The narrative may be considered to consist of four plots with unequal emphasis: the life of Dorothea Brooke, the career of Tertius Lydgate, the courtship of Mary Garth by Fred Vincy, and the disgrace of Nicholas Bulstrode. The two main plots are those of Dorothea and Lydgate. Dorothea Brooke is a 19-year-old orphan living with her sister Celia and uncle Mr Brooke. She does renovation of buildings and is courted by Sir James Chettam, though she doesn&rsquo;t recognize it. She falls for Rev. Edward Casaubon, a 45-year-old scholar while Chettam directs feelings to Celia. Fred and Rosamond Vincy are issues of landlord; Fred is a failure and a layabout but heir of his childless uncle Mr Featherstone, a rich but unpleasant man. Featherstone has a niece of his by marriage, Mary Garth; Fred is in love with her and wants to marry her. Dorothea and Casaubon marry and on their honeymoon in Italy, Dorothea finds that her husband has no interest in involving her in his intellectual pursuits. She meets Will Ladislaw, cousin of Casaubon; he instantly falls for her. Fred loses all money and since he had gotten signs of Mr Caleb Garth on bonds, they forfeit their savings; so he warns Mary against ever marrying Fred. Fred gets sick and treated by Dr Tertius Lydgate, new doctor with modern ideas. He allies himself with Bulstrode, a wealthy, church-going landowner and developer who wants to build a hospital and clinic that follow Lydgate&#39;s philosophy, despite the misgivings of Lydgate&#39;s friend, Farebrother, about Bulstrode&#39;s integrity. Rosamond decides to marry Lydgate; become engaged. Casaubon suffers a heart attack; he later dies with a provision in his will that, if Dorothea marries Ladislaw, she will lose her inheritance. Featherstone dies with 2 wills: Featherstone&#39;s plan had been for &pound;10,000 to go to Fred Vincy, but his estate and fortune instead go to his illegitimate son, Joshua Rigg. Fred has a change of heart and resolves to train as a land agent</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;under the forgiving Caleb. John Raffles, a mysterious man who knows of Bulstrode&#39;s shady past, appears in Middlemarch. Bulstrode marrieda wealty old widower. Her daughter had run away and even though he located her, instead of her daughter, he inherited the fortune</span><span class="c3">. The daughter had a son whois recognized as Ladislaw. Ladislaw doesn&rsquo;t accept inheritance as he sees it as tainted. Later, Dorothea renounces her property and announces to marry him. Fred, having been successful in his new career, marries Mary. Ladislaw engages in public reform, and Dorothea is content as a wife and mother to their two children. Their son eventually inherits Arthur Brooke&#39;s estate. </span><span class="c11 c30">Emily Dickinson, Letter to her cousins Louise and Fannie Norcross</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;wrote: &quot;What do I think of &#39;Middlemarch&#39;?&quot; What do I think of glory &ndash; except that in a few instances this &quot;mortal has already put on immortality.&quot; George Eliot was one.

A. Streatfeild made substantial changes to Butler&#39;s manuscript. The novel takes its beginnings in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries to trace Ernest&#39;s emergence from previous generations of the Pontifex family. John Pontifex was a carpenter; his son George rises in the world to become a publisher; George&#39;s son Theobald, pressed by his father to become a minister, is manipulated into marrying Christina, the daughter of a clergyman; the main character Ernest Pontifex is the eldest son of </span><span class="c7 c3">Theobald and Christina</span><span class="c0">; antagonistic relationship between Ernest and his hypocritical and domineering parents. His aunt Althea aware of this secretly passes a small fortune into Overton&#39;s keeping, with the agreement that once Ernest is twenty-eight, he can receive it. He travels a bumpy theological road he starts out as an&nbsp;Evangelical&nbsp;Christian, and soon becomes a clergyman. He then falls for the lures of the High Church. Decides the way to regenerate the Church of England is to live among the poor faith as a result &nbsp;his integrity of the Bible is severely damaged by a conversation with one of the poor he was hoping to convert, and, second, that under the pressures of poverty and theological doubt, he attempts a sexual assault on a woman he has incorrectly believed to be of loose morals. Lands him in prison. Learns tailoring. His parents disown him. His health deteriorates. He rejects Christianity as superstition. He marries Ellen, a former housemaid of his parents who turns out to be a bigamist and an alcoholic. Overton at this point intervenes and pays Ellen a stipend, and she happily leaves with another for America. At 28, he receives his aunt Alethea&#39;s gift.

(She hesitates to accept Squire Tub, however, because of the social gap between them: &quot;He&#39;s too fine for me, and has a Lady / Tub to his mother.&quot;) Amid the disorder, Pol-Marten, Lady Tub&#39;s usher, marries Audrey before others realise it. Their marriage is celebrated with a wedding masque, also titled &quot;A Tale of a Tub,&quot; which retells the story of the play.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c5">The Isle of Dogs</span><span class="c2 c0 c1">&nbsp;(performed 1597, with Thomas Nashe; lost): A satirical comedy.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c5">The Case is Altered</span><span class="c2 c0 c1">&nbsp;(c. 1597&ndash;98; published 1609): comedy written possibly with Henry Porter and Anthony Munday.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c5">Every Man in His Humour</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;(performed 1598; published 1601): The play was revived around 1670;&nbsp;</span><span class="c0 c1"><a class="c4" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Sackville,_6th_Earl_of_Dorset&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1736319031325203&amp;usg=AOvVaw2uor8Yk_QdJEDekwvWdGPO">Sackville</a></span><span class="c2 c0 c1">&nbsp;provided a verse epilogue in which Jonson himself appeared as a ghost. Shakespeare acted in it. Modelled on Roman comedy. Prologue attacks contemporary drama and explains his own aim: he will not &ldquo;serve the ill customs of the age&rdquo;. The play first set in Italy then in London. Much of the dialogue is in prose with blank verse largely confined to expository passages. Two plots. In the main plot, Wdward Kno&#39;well, a concerned father, spies on his city-gallant son using his servant Brainworm, whose antics continually subvert the plan. These characters are Anglicized versions of ancient Greek New Comedy types: the senex, the son, and the slave. In the subplot, merchant Kitely&#39;s intense jealousy leads him to suspect his wife, Dame of infidelity with wastrels brought by his brother-in-law, Wellbred. Surrounding these plots are various English &quot;humorous&quot; characters, including an irascible soldier named Bobadill (one of Jonson&rsquo;s greatest characters), a country gull, pretentious poets, a surly water-bearer, and an avuncular judge. The play concludes with Justice Clement resolving all grievances, revealing them as rooted in humour, misperception, or deceit. The play adheres to Aristotelian unities.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c5">Every Man out of His Humour</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;(performed 1599; printed 1600): a satirical&nbsp;</span><span class="c0 c1"><a class="c4" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comedy_play&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1736319031325511&amp;usg=AOvVaw0N-ETtKus795KRGbZMZCfb">comedy play</a></span><span class="c0">.

The play is episodic ad features various characters, each dominated by specific &ldquo;humours&rdquo; or obsessive quirks of disposition. Macilente, a venomous malcontent, flees to the countryside due to society&rsquo;s injustices. Sogliardo, an essential clown, seeks guidance from cynical jester Carlo Buffone to become a gentleman. Sir Fastidious Brisk, a braggart courtier, interacts with other characters. Puntarvolo, a fantastic, vainglorious knight, wagers that he and his wife can travel to Constantinople and back without mishap. Jonson himself is introduced as Asper explaining and commeting on the action in conversation with his friends Cordatus and Mitis (who act as a sort of chorus). Jonson explained his theory of humour in the &ldquo;induction&rdquo; of this play (4 humours: choler, melancholy, phlegm and blood).

In the main story, the goddess Diana, also called Cynthia, organizes a &quot;solemn revels&quot; in Greece. The gods Cupid and Mercury appear and argue, with Mercury awakening Echo, who mourns for Narcissus. Drinking from Narcissus&#39;s spring causes the courtiers and ladies at Cynthia&#39;s revels to become vain and self-absorbed. Asotus, a foolish spendthrift, also drinks from the spring and, emboldened by vanity, challenges others to a competition of &quot;court compliment.&quot; He wins the competition, which has four phases, against the courtiers. Two symbolic masques are performed, revealing that vices have been masquerading as virtues. Cynthia, representing Queen Elizabeth, orders the revelers to purify themselves by bathing in the spring at Mount Helicon. The character Actaeon may represent Robert Devereux, while Cynthia&#39;s lady-in-waiting, Arete, may represent Lucy, Countess of Bedford, Jonson&#39;s patroness.

The play follows William Touchstone, a London goldsmith, who reprimands his lazy apprentice, Francis &quot;Frank&quot; Quicksilver, while praising his industrious apprentice, Golding. Touchstone hopes Golding will marry his modest daughter, Mildred. Meanwhile, Touchstone&#39;s vain daughter, Gertrude, marries the fraudulent and bankrupt Sir Petronel Flash, hoping to elevate her social status. After Gertrude&#39;s costly wedding, Touchstone dismisses Quicksilver for his gluttony. Quicksilver and Petronel, seeking quick wealth, plan a voyage to Virginia, funded by Gertrude&#39;s dowry. They deceive various characters, including Gertrude and Security, a usurer whose wife, Winifred, is seduced by Petronel. During their voyage, a storm shipwrecks them. Quicksilver and Petronel, stranded and disoriented, plan to make counterfeit money. Back in London, Golding, now a Master Deputy Alderman, learns of their crimes. Petronel and Quicksilver are arrested and confess their wrongdoings. Quicksilver&#39;s repentance moves Touchstone, who forgives them and reinstates Quicksilver as his apprentice and Petronel as his son-in-law.

Corvino, thinking Volpone can be cured by lying next to a young woman, offers Celia, hoping to secure his inheritance. When Volpone tries to assault Celia, Bonario intervenes. However, in court, the truth is buried by Voltore&#39;s legal skills and false testimonies from Mosca and the others.

However, after the marriage, Epic&oelig;ne reveals herself to be loud and nagging, much to Morose&#39;s dismay.

They trick Dapper, a lawyer&#39;s clerk, Drugger, a tobacconist, and Sir Epicure Mammon, a nobleman seeking the philosopher&#39;s stone.

The story begins with Littlewit and his friends, Quarlous and Winwife, scheming to woo Dame Purecraft away from the hypocritical Puritan Zeal-of-the-Land Busy. Meanwhile, Cokes, a country simpleton, and his entourage, including Grace Wellborn and Justice Overdo, are at Littlewit&#39;s house to obtain a marriage license and plan a visit to the fair. At the fair, the characters face chaos: Overdo is mistaken for a criminal and put in the stocks, Quarlous and Winwife seek to win Grace, and various schemes unfold involving stolen marriage licenses, disguises, and mistaken identities.

Pug convinces Satan to let him try, and is sent to torment the foolish gentleman Fabian Fitzdottrel. Fitzdottrel, obsessed with encountering a devil and finding treasure, is easily duped by various con artists. These include Wittipol and Manly, who seek to seduce Fitzdottrel&#39;s wife, and Meercraft, who schemes to steal Fitzdottrel&#39;s wealth through fraudulent projects. Meercraft manipulates Fitzdottrel into giving away his fortune, pretending to be a &quot;Spanish woman&quot; to gain access to Mistress Fitzdottrel. Pug tries to tempt Mistress Fitzdottrel into infidelity, but his efforts are clumsy and lead to him being beaten. Wittipol, moved by Mistress Fitzdottrel&#39;s plea for help, abandons his lustful pursuit and works with Manly to shift control of Fitzdottrel&#39;s fortune to Mistress Fitzdottrel, thwarting Meercraft&#39;s plan. As Meercraft attempts to regain control through deceit, Pug ends up imprisoned. In a final twist, Fitzdottrel realizes Pug was a devil, exposes the schemes, and restores order.

Pennyboy Junior visits the News Staple, managed by Cymbal, who is also a suitor of Pecunia. The rival Pennyboy Senior tries to win Pecunia by bribing her servants but is mocked by the jeerers, led by Cymbal. The rivalry escalates, with Junior spending extravagantly and Pecunia being tracked by the jeerers. Pennyboy Cantor reveals his true identity, denounces his son, and withdraws Pecunia.

The play is set in Charlemagne&#39;s court, embroiled in political intrigue and personal conflicts. Act I reveals Charlemagne&#39;s marriage to Theodora and introduces her scheming siblings, Ganelon and Gabriella. Ganelon is promoted to Constable, while Orlando&rsquo;s conquests in Spain are celebrated. In Act II, Orlando learns of Theodora&rsquo;s death and the birth of her son, leading Charlemagne to mourn deeply until Richard discovers a mysterious ring, which causes Charlemagne to fall for Bishop Turpin and punish Ganelon. Act III shows Charlemagne&rsquo;s mental decline as he listens to sycophants, further punishes Ganelon, and Gabriella suffers separation from Richard. In subsequent acts, La Busse petitions for his father&#39;s restored titles, and Richard is murdered by Ganelon, whose crimes and Gabriella&rsquo;s false letter are exposed. Charlemagne ultimately orders Ganelon&rsquo;s execution, rewards Orlando with Spain, and the play concludes with a dramatic resolution of its complex plot.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c5">Sir Giles Goosecap</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;(1601): </span><span class="c0 c1"><a class="c4" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comedy&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1736319031338061&amp;usg=AOvVaw31zoNQ2DL_45f36H4evTnI">comedy</a></span><span class="c0">&nbsp;first published anonymously, and generally attributed to&nbsp;</span><span class="c0 c1"><a class="c4" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Chapman&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1736319031338180&amp;usg=AOvVaw0yU88OEMa25pRI5H-9_6qI">George Chapman</a></span><span class="c2 c0 c1">.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c5">Bussy D&#39;Ambois</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;(1603): Classified as either a&nbsp;</span><span class="c0 c1"><a class="c4" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tragedy&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1736319031338400&amp;usg=AOvVaw0umRryJbu98zxTQ6fuBeYP">tragedy</a></span><span class="c0">&nbsp;or &quot;contemporary history&quot;.

Bussy&rsquo;s wild temperament soon causes conflict, leading him to quarrel with courtiers and survive a triple duel. He begins an affair with Tamyra, the wife of the powerful Count Mountsurry, who tortures her to reveal the affair.

Each has two children: Gostanzo&#39;s son Valerio and daughter Bellomora, and Marc Antonio&#39;s sons Fortunio and Rynaldo. Valerio secretly marries the poor Gratiana but is unable to publicly acknowledge it due to his father&rsquo;s opposition. Fortunio loves Bellomora but cannot court her. Gostanzo discovers Valerio with Gratiana and, manipulated by Rynaldo, mistakenly believes Gratiana is Fortunio&#39;s wife. He tells Marc Antonio, who, enraged, drives Fortunio away to war. Gostanzo&rsquo;s plans eventually result in Fortunio and Gratiana living with him, allowing Valerio and Gratiana to be together and Fortunio to pursue Bellomora. Gostanzo&rsquo;s further meddling nearly derails these arrangements, but ultimately Valerio and Gratiana&rsquo;s marriage is publicly accepted, and Fortunio marries Bellomora. The subplot involves Cornelio&rsquo;s irrational jealousy of his wife Gazetta, leading to legal and medical humor, which ends with Cornelio reconciling with his wife.

The play centers on Vandome, a French gentleman who returns from a three-year journey to find his friends and family in disarray. His chivalrous affection for Marcellina, the wife of his friend Count Vaumont, led to Marcellina retreating into nocturnal seclusion, while her husband&rsquo;s jealousy grew. Vandome also discovers that his sister has died and her grieving husband, the Earl of St. Anne, has embalmed her body. Vandome resolves these issues by orchestrating a romance between the Earl and Eurione, Marcellina&rsquo;s sister, who secretly loves the Earl. Meanwhile, Vandome tricks Marcellina and Eurione into confronting the Count Vaumont with false accusations of infidelity, thereby ending Marcellina&rsquo;s seclusion. The subplot features Monsieur D&rsquo;Olive, a vain and pompous gallant, who is duped by courtiers Mugeron and Rodrigue into believing he is on an important embassy. His subsequent attempts to fulfill this role result in comical embarrassment.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c5">The Widow&#39;s Tears</span><span class="c2 c0 c1">&nbsp;(1605): considered the last of Chapman&#39;s comedies. Set on the island of Cyprus, The Widow&#39;s Tears follows two plots involving the brothers Lysander and Tharsalio. Tharsalio, a wild and cunning youth, seeks to marry the wealthy widow, Countess Eudora, despite her vow never to remarry. Competing with the pompous Rebus, Tharsalio&#39;s bold strategy involves warning Eudora about his own reputation as a womanizer, subtly arousing her desires, leading to their marriage by the third act. In the main plot of the final two acts, Tharsalio, irritated by Lysander&#39;s criticism, provokes him into doubting his wife Cynthia&#39;s vow of fidelity. Lysander fakes his death to test her, returning disguised as a soldier. In a graveyard, he finds Cynthia mourning, weakens her resolve, and convinces her to &quot;marry&quot; him in his disguise. Tharsalio, unaware of the soldier&#39;s true identity, spies on them and believes his cynical views on women are confirmed. Lysander&#39;s ruse eventually leads to his arrest and a legal mess, which the now-married Eudora helps resolve. In the end, Lysander accepts the situation, recognizing that Cynthia remained a &quot;constant wife&quot; despite being deceived.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c5">The Gentleman Usher</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;(1606): alternative title&nbsp;</span><span class="c0 c7">Vincentio and Margaret</span><span class="c2 c0 c1">&nbsp;(the names of its hero and heroine). The play is set in an Italian duchy ruled by Duke Alphonso, who, along with his son Prince Vincentio, is in love with Margaret, the daughter of Earl Lasso. Alphonso&#39;s plan to marry Margaret is supported by his court favorite, Medice, a disliked and illiterate poseur. Vincentio, with the help of his friend Strozza, pursues Margaret and wins her affection, pledging a spiritual marriage. As tensions rise, Strozza is wounded, and Medice manipulates events to expose Vincentio&rsquo;s romance. Alphonso orders Vincentio&rsquo;s capture, but Medice defies orders and severely injures him. Margaret, desperate to avoid a forced marriage, disfigures herself but is later healed along with Vincentio. In the end, Medice is exposed as a fraud, beaten, and driven out, while Vincentio and Margaret are united. Strozza&rsquo;s final speech reflects on the nature of virtue and authority, highlighting Chapman&rsquo;s philosophical concerns.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c5">The Conspiracy and Tragedy of Charles, Duke of Byron</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;(1608): Follows the formidable soldier Byron, whose overweening pride becomes his downfall. Obsessed with comparing himself to ancient heroes like Hercules and Alexander the Great, Byron&#39;s vanity makes him vulnerable to manipulation by enemies of the King of France. Despite becoming aware of Byron&rsquo;s treason, the King values his past service and tries to reform him, even sending him to England to observe a stable monarchy. Byron temporarily curbs his pride, but his ego leads him back to plotting. Ultimately, he is apprehended, tried, convicted, and executed. Byron&rsquo;s rebellion is likened to Catiline&#39;s revolt against Rome and the Earl of Essex&rsquo;s uprising against Elizabeth I.

Lorenzo wants Aemilia to marry the wealthy but repulsive Gasparo, though Aemilia prefers Aurelio. Lodovico, Lorenzo&rsquo;s nephew, helps bring the shy Aemilia and Aurelio together. Quintiliano, a boastful soldier, swindles a scholar named Giovenelle. Meanwhile, Lucretia, a mysterious woman staying with Aurelio&rsquo;s father, becomes a target for seducers. Lodovico and Angelo trick Lorenzo into disguising himself as a chimney sweep, leading to his humiliation. Eventually, it&rsquo;s revealed that Lucretia is actually a man named Lucretio in disguise, and his betrothed, Theagine, is disguised as the page Lionell. The play concludes with Lorenzo consenting to the marriage of Aurelio and Aemilia, and all loving couples are happily united.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c5">The Revenge of Bussy D&#39;Ambois</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;(1610): a&nbsp;</span><span class="c0 c1"><a class="c4" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literature_in_English%23Jacobean_literature&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1736319031342955&amp;usg=AOvVaw3VUNZkmnk0BZkYTZS2a__Z">Jacobean</a></span><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span><span class="c0 c1"><a class="c4" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revenge_play&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1736319031343062&amp;usg=AOvVaw16gtjD2nNu1cKi2_mxH0Nf">revenge tragedy</a></span><span class="c0">.

Meanwhile, Clermont is pressured by Tamyra, Bussy&#39;s former lover, to avenge her husband Montsurry, who was responsible for Bussy&#39;s death. Montsurry evades confrontation until Bussy&#39;s ghost compels Clermont to ensure Montsurry&#39;s death in a final duel.

PLOT: Duke Pietro of Genoa is troubled by the critical guest Malevole, who reveals Pietro&#39;s wife Aurelia&#39;s affair with adopted heir Mendoza. Malevole is actually Altofronto, the deposed Duke of Genoa, seeking revenge. Altofronto, aided by Celso, plots to reclaim his position. He warns Pietro of Mendoza&#39;s plan to murder him and marry Aurelia. Malevole provides Mendoza with two poison boxes, but instead disguises Pietro as a hermit to testify to his own death. Mendoza exiles Aurelia and orders Malevole to marry Maria and kill the disguised Pietro. Malevole convinces Aurelia to repent, and Maria remains faithful. Mendoza&rsquo;s attempt to poison Altofronto fails, and at a masquerade ball, Altofronto, Pietro, and Ferneze expose Mendoza&rsquo;s schemes.

In the play the contrast between the cunning ignorance of the illiterate Wise Woman and the pedantic Latin-speaker Sir Boniface drives much of the comedy. The Wise Woman, residing in the city&#39;s disreputable outskirts, orchestrates the play&rsquo;s resolution while navigating the disruptive actions of the dissolute Young Chartley and the crossed-dressed heroine, Luce 2. Luce 2, an aristocrat in disguise, seeks to marry Young Chartley but discovers him pursuing the citizen Luce 1, who lacks agency and is bound by her social status. The play unfolds as Luce 2&rsquo;s pursuit of Chartley and her intervention lead to the resolution of conflicts. Young Chartley, who objectifies women in terms of wealth and possession, regrets his marriage to Luce 1 and desires Gratiana, another woman he sees as more desirable. His shift in affection fuels the play&#39;s comic and dramatic action.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c5">The Captives</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;(licensed 1624); </span><span class="c5">A Pleasant Comedy, called A Maidenhead Well Lost</span><span class="c2 c0 c1">&nbsp;(performed and published 1634): a dark comedy set in Italy.

A sub-plot of the play is the story of Lauretta, who finds herself banished from the court of Milan and ends up falling in love with the Prince of Florence.

Lauretta finds refuge with the Prince of Florence, who falls for her. Stroza leaves Julia&#39;s baby in the woods, but Parma saves it, suspecting Stroza&rsquo;s deception. The Duke arranges Julia&rsquo;s marriage to the Prince of Florence, while Parma sows doubt about Julia&rsquo;s virginity.

The play is set in Lancashire, around Pendle Hill, featuring various locations including Master Generous&#39; house and the Seely family home. The Prologue references convicted witches awaiting execution in Fleet Prison. In the first act, three gentlemen&mdash;Arthur, Shakestone, and Bantam&mdash;experience mysterious disruptions and encounter Whetstone, who is socially scorned. The conversation reveals the Seely family&rsquo;s reversed roles, with Lawrence and Parnell planning to become masters, leaving the Seelys as lodgers. The witches, introduced in Act 2, sing a song about feeding their familiars with their blood and plan further mischief. Meanwhile, Generous discusses Whetstone&#39;s foolishness, and Robin, Generous&#39; servant, encounters Mall Spencer, who showcases her magical abilities. The boy, who originally spread tales of witchcraft, finds himself abducted by witches disguised as greyhounds. As the witches&#39; tricks continue, they disrupt a wedding feast prepared by the Seelys, turning food inedible and causing chaos. Generous discovers his wife&rsquo;s witchcraft when she is transformed into a horse by Robin, leading to a confession of her pact with the devil. Mistress Generous&rsquo; penitence is questioned, and the witches&#39; power begins to wane. The Seelys are taken into care, and Parnell&rsquo;s scandalous behavior leads to a skimmington ride mocking her and her husband. Whetstone seeks revenge, using his aunt&#39;s powers to embarrass the gentlemen. In the final act, Doughty, now a witch-finder, and the boy recount their stories. The mill is attacked by witches, and Generous finds undeniable proof of Mistress Generous&rsquo; witchcraft. The witches are arrested, and the Seelys return to normal. The play concludes with an Epilogue reflecting on mercy and justice for the accused.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2 c11 c1">ROMANCES:</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c11">&nbsp;</span><span class="c5">The Four Prentices of London</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;(performed c. 1592; published 1615), a romantic drama.

PLOT: The old Earl of Boloigne has four sons&mdash;Godfrey, Guy, Charles, and Eustace&mdash;and a daughter, Bella Franca. Due to his loss of the earldom, they are apprentices: Godfrey a mercer, Guy a goldsmith, Charles a haberdasher, and Eustace a grocer. He departs for a pilgrimage to Jerusalem, instructing his sons to remain good apprentices. Enrolled in a crusade led by Robert, Duke of Normandy, the brothers are shipwrecked and separated. Godfrey ends up in Spain, helps reclaim his father&#39;s title, and becomes Earl of Boloigne. Guy lands in France, where the King&rsquo;s daughter falls in love with him and follows him disguised as a page. Charles reaches Italy, defeats a band of thieves, and becomes their leader. Eustace washes ashore in Ireland. Bella Franca travels to Jerusalem, where the brothers and Tancred, the County Palatine, fall in love with her, leading to conflicts.

The title deliberately echoes that of Samuel Rowley&#39;s 1605 play </span><span class="c0 c7">When You See Me You Know Me</span><span class="c0">. The play chronicles the key events of Queen Mary I&#39;s reign and concludes with Queen Elizabeth&#39;s accession. Part 1 was popular, with multiple editions published between 1605 and 1639, likely performed by Queen Anne&#39;s Men. Part 2 focuses on the building of the Royal Exchange by Thomas Gresham and the antics of Hobson, a haberdasher. Hobson struggles with his unruly apprentices, particularly John Gresham, who flees to France after stealing 100 pounds. Hobson chases John to France, where John tricks him into believing a courtesan is a reputable businesswoman. Hobson eventually brings John back to England. The play then shifts to Queen Elizabeth&#39;s life, where Hobson boldly introduces himself to the Queen during a pageant but is surprised she doesn&#39;t remember him. The play ends with Elizabeth surviving an assassination plot by Doctor William Parry and the defeat of the Spanish Armada by Sir Francis Drake.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c5">Edward IV</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;Parts One and Two: a two-part&nbsp;</span><span class="c0 c1"><a class="c4" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_literature%23Elizabethan_era&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1736319031358869&amp;usg=AOvVaw1UguLUEgW70dpUxeILE9m7">Elizabethan</a></span><span class="c0">&nbsp;history play centring on the personal life of King&nbsp;</span><span class="c0 c1"><a class="c4" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_IV_of_England&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1736319031359069&amp;usg=AOvVaw39P4vT2N7LbQtWdeugLnSq">Edward IV of England</a></span><span class="c0">.

Viola, unhappy with her overly patient husband, Candido, plots with her brother Fustigo to provoke him. Meanwhile, Infelice awakens and is sent to Bergamo, where Hippolito plans to meet her. Bellafront, a former prostitute, falls in love with Hippolito and vows to change her ways. Various characters, including Candido, are involved in schemes and misunderstandings, culminating at the Bethlem Monastery, where Hippolito and Infelice marry. The Duke eventually accepts the marriage, and Candido is freed, proving his sanity. Part 2: In this second part, Hippolito has conceived a violent lust for Bellafront, whose husband has (perhaps not surprisingly) returned to the life of a wastrel. Yet, despite her dire need, Bellafront refuses to surrender her new virtue.

Jolenta loves Contarino, but Romelio&#39;s manipulations lead to a duel between Contarino and Ercole, where both are wounded. Believing Contarino dead, Romelio plots to pass off his illegitimate child as Jolenta&#39;s, intending to secure both inheritances. Meanwhile, their mother, Leonora, disgusted by Romelio&#39;s actions, falsely claims in court that Romelio is illegitimate to strip him of his estates. Contarino, who survives the attempted murder by Romelio, disrupts a planned duel between Romelio and Ercole by revealing his survival. In the end, Romelio is forced to restore Contarino&#39;s fortune, marry the nun he impregnated, and Jolenta is left unmarried. Leonora, Jolenta, and the nun are sentenced to build a monastery as penance, while the subplot of Julio&#39;s reckless behavior blends with the main story.

After Annabel&#39;s kindness, Rochfield joins Woodroff&#39;s trading voyage, becomes a hero, and gains wealth. Back in England, Clare admits she loved Bonvile, causing a series of misunderstandings. Woodroff resolves the conflicts between Annabel, Bonvile, Clare, Lessingham, and Rochfield. In the subplot, Compass returns home to find his wife Urse with an illegitimate child.

Appius Claudius, initially feigning modesty, covets a position among the Decemviri and manipulates his way into power. He lusts after Virginia, daughter of Virginius, who is away commanding the army. Appius, with the help of his ally Marcus Claudius, fabricates evidence to claim that Virginia is a bond-slave rather than Virginius&#39;s daughter. Virginia is seized and Appius stages a false trial, ruling in Marcus&#39;s favor. Virginius returns to Rome and, in a desperate attempt to protect his daughter from Appius&rsquo;s advances, kills her in court. Virginius then rallies his soldiers and returns to Rome. The Senate imprisons Appius and Marcus. Icilius, who is initially imprisoned, joins Virginius in seeking justice. Virginius shows Virginia&#39;s body to the public, inciting their anger against Appius. Appius commits suicide, while Marcus is executed.

PLOT: follows Bianca, who elopes with the poor Leantio and is locked up by his mother. While imprisoned, the Duke of Florence, aided by the widow Livia (playing chess with mother), rapes Bianca (one of the great moments in Jacobean drama). Disillusioned with Leantio and his poverty, Bianca becomes the Duke&#39;s mistress. Livia&#39;s brother, Hippolito, is in love with his niece Isabella, who is set to marry the foolish Ward. Livia deceitfully informs Isabella that she is illegitimate, leading Isabella and Hippolito into an affair. Livia, in turn, becomes Leantio&#39;s mistress. The story spirals into tragedy as Hippolito learns of Livia&#39;s affair and kills Leantio. Livia, grieving, reveals Isabella&#39;s true relation to Hippolito. During a masque celebrating Bianca&#39;s marriage to the Duke, chaos erupts: Hippolito is killed by poisoned arrows, Isabella and Livia kill each other, and Bianca accidentally poisons the Duke, then herself.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c5">Anything for a Quiet Life</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;(1621) (co-written with John Webster); </span><span class="c5">The Changeling</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;(1622) (co-written with Rowley): a&nbsp;</span><span class="c0 c1"><a class="c4" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacobean_literature&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1736319031383695&amp;usg=AOvVaw3ljsUvlcgHn39AFRDyZWs9">Jacobean</a></span><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span><span class="c0 c1"><a class="c4" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tragedy&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1736319031383823&amp;usg=AOvVaw1jnrSy9xNTqpbzWEK-lEdo">tragedy</a></span><span class="c2 c0 c1">.

The Black House schemes to corrupt and manipulate, including the Black Queen&#39;s Pawn&#39;s failed seduction of the White Queen&#39;s Pawn and the Black Bishop&#39;s Pawn&rsquo;s attempt to rape her. The Black Knight Gondomar covers up the scandal and deceives others, including the Fat Bishop of Spalato, who switches sides for power. The White Queen&#39;s Pawn is wrongly punished for slander. Later, the Fat Bishop rejoins the Black House, and various deceptions continue. The Black Queen&#39;s Pawn tricks the Black Bishop&#39;s Pawn, while the White Knight and White Duke infiltrate the Black House.

Arbaces discovers that his mother, Arane, has plotted his assassination, but the regent Gobrius has thwarted it. Tigranes&#39; fianc&eacute;e, Spaconia, follows him, hoping to prevent the marriage. Arbaces becomes infatuated with Panthea and struggles with incestuous desires, while Panthea remains virtuous. In his desperation, Arbaces considers murdering Gobrius, raping Panthea, and then committing suicide. Tigranes, despite his love for Panthea, remains faithful to Spaconia. The crisis is resolved when it is revealed that Arbaces is actually Gobrius&rsquo;s son and not Panthea&rsquo;s brother. The whole situation was a ruse to secure a rightful heir. Arbaces marries Panthea but abdicates the throne. His flawed character is attributed to his non-royal lineage. Comic relief comes from the cowardly Bessus and his cronies, who comically mishandle dueling customs.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c5">The Captain</span><span class="c2 c0 c1">, comedy (c. 1609&ndash;12; 1647)</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c5">The Scornful Lady</span><span class="c2 c0 c1">, comedy (c. 1613; 1616): Thomas Shadwell borrowed from the Beaumont/Fletcher play for his own The Woman-Captain (1680).</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c5">Love&#39;s Pilgrimage</span><span class="c0">, tragicomedy (c. 1615&ndash;16; 1647): its opening scene contains material from&nbsp;</span><span class="c0 c1"><a class="c4" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ben_Jonson&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1736319031389760&amp;usg=AOvVaw07QsXKW4x5bMjJAdbwRXIV">Ben Jonson</a></span><span class="c0">&#39;s&nbsp;</span><span class="c0 c1"><a class="c4" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1629_in_literature&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1736319031389892&amp;usg=AOvVaw2CZFpr0LWU7Fl3lJPcjakD">1629</a></span><span class="c0">&nbsp;comedy&nbsp;</span><span class="c0 c1 c7"><a class="c4" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_Inn&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1736319031390000&amp;usg=AOvVaw08jxQpsdXDXSfm6buX5B3c">The New Inn</a></span><span class="c0">.

To curb the negative effects of his ambition, she and her friends deceive him into believing he has been rapidly promoted through the social ranks&mdash;from knight to baron to earl, and finally to duke. This fictitious rise is accompanied by a corresponding, fictitious decline in his wealth. By the end of the play, Mount-Marine is convinced that he remains the Duke of Burgundy, though he must keep this title secret. Simultaneously, Chatillion, another character driven mad by love, imagines himself as a claimant to the French throne and perceives imaginary dangers around him. His delusions mirror the absurdity of Mount-Marine&rsquo;s situation, highlighting the farcical nature of their respective predicaments.</span></p><h1 class="c9"><span class="c8">John Fletcher&nbsp;(1579 &ndash; 1625)</span></h1><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Remains an important transitional figure between the Elizabethan popular tradition and the&nbsp;</span><span class="c0 c1"><a class="c4" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Restoration_literature&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1736319031390833&amp;usg=AOvVaw38W0S2LQwlbVBPbHHeOFY0">popular drama of the Restoration</a></span><span class="c0">.

PLOT: Clorin, a virgin shepherdess and skilled healer, lives near the grave of her first love. She helps various couples through their erotic turmoil. In the first storyline, the shepherd Perigot loves the pure shepherdess Amoret, but the scheming Amarillis disguises herself as Amoret to seduce Perigot. Perigot, deceived, stabs Amoret, who is saved by the river god. Misunderstandings lead Perigot to stab Amoret again. Clorin heals Amoret and cleanses Perigot of his guilt. In the second storyline, the lustful shepherdess Cloe seeks any lover, initially failing with the restrained Daphnis but succeeding with Alexis. The Sullen Shepherd attacks Alexis, and Cloe flees. Clorin heals Alexis and purges Cloe of her desire. In the third storyline, Thenot is in love with Clorin but desires her only for her constancy to her deceased lover. Clorin pretends to love him, causing Thenot to lose interest and flee. By the end, Amarillis repents and is pardoned, the Sullen Shepherd is banished, and the couples&mdash;Perigot and Amoret, Cloe and Alexis&mdash;commit to faithful love.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c5">Valentinian</span><span class="c0">, tragedy (1610&ndash;14; 1647): a&nbsp;</span><span class="c0 c1"><a class="c4" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revenge_tragedy&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1736319031392120&amp;usg=AOvVaw1i7TONJNSb4Ls2Q4VpKUPX">revenge tragedy</a></span><span class="c0">&nbsp;based on the life of the&nbsp;</span><span class="c0 c1"><a class="c4" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_emperor&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1736319031392235&amp;usg=AOvVaw0J54C1WnWHgxb800Ll9B6k">Roman emperor</a></span><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span><span class="c0 c1"><a class="c4" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valentinian_III&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1736319031392397&amp;usg=AOvVaw3R-X25Qjni55aaB5EmUVL3">Valentinian III</a></span><span class="c0">. &nbsp;His assassin in the play is based on&nbsp;</span><span class="c0 c1"><a class="c4" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petronius_Maximus&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1736319031392487&amp;usg=AOvVaw0UhSXtFLfuUtMslnAzubeQ">Petronius Maximus</a></span><span class="c0">&nbsp;(r. 455), Valentinian&#39;s short-reigning successor. &nbsp;An adaptation under the same title by the poet and playwright&nbsp;</span><span class="c0 c1"><a class="c4" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Wilmot,_2nd_Earl_of_Rochester&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1736319031392591&amp;usg=AOvVaw26He6m3krbJAd88oSd_2bF">John Wilmot, 2nd Earl of Rochester</a></span><span class="c0">&nbsp;.

Petruchio&#39;s final attempt to gain Maria&#39;s sympathy by pretending to be dead backfires as she mourns his foolishness. She declares she has tamed him, and they agree to start anew.

(There are fully eleven scenes in Act I.). PLOT: In Bologna, Don John and Don Frederick, two Spanish gentlemen, seek the famous beauty Costantia. John inadvertently receives a baby from a mysterious woman and takes it to his lodging, while Frederick mistakenly helps the actual Costantia, who is under threat. The city is in turmoil due to a conflict between the Duke of Ferrara and Petrucchio, Costantia&#39;s brother. John aids the Duke in the skirmish, discovering that Costantia&#39;s child is the Duke&#39;s son, and that Petrucchio seeks revenge for the Duke&#39;s seduction of his sister. Confusion ensues as Costantia and the baby go missing, and the friends suspect each other of dishonesty. They overhear a conversation about another Costantia, leading to further misunderstandings. The true Costantia is found, along with the baby, and a fraudulent conjuring act reveals the truth. All parties are reconciled, and the play ends happily.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c5">Wit Without Money</span><span class="c0">, comedy (c. 1614; 1639): Written mostly in prose instead of verse. &nbsp;</span><span class="c0 c1"><a class="c4" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herman_Melville&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1736319031394532&amp;usg=AOvVaw01g6e9s5-oQdvSYDd7nbmo">Herman Melville</a></span><span class="c0">&nbsp;chose one of the epigraphs in his collection&nbsp;</span><span class="c0 c1 c7"><a class="c4" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Encantadas&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1736319031394665&amp;usg=AOvVaw0ABj49GDL2g-6fxGDueHa_">The Encantadas</a></span><span class="c0">&nbsp;from this play. &nbsp;</span><span class="c0 c1"><a class="c4" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Dryden&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1736319031394745&amp;usg=AOvVaw3oNjDOvpJk1btNhDW-fwAy">John Dryden</a></span><span class="c0">&nbsp;wrote a Prologue for its&nbsp;</span><span class="c0 c1"><a class="c4" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1672_in_literature&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1736319031394826&amp;usg=AOvVaw0jeZc637D_MsRVz5zMkBIL">1672</a></span><span class="c2 c0 c1">&nbsp;revival. PLOT: Valentine, a young gentleman who has squandered his estate, disregards his Uncle&#39;s advice to marry a wealthy woman to restore his fortunes. His irresponsible lifestyle has also harmed his younger brother Francisco&rsquo;s annuity. Valentine, who mocks marriage and women, is involved with suitors Fountain, Bellamore, and Hairbrain, who are courting the wealthy widow Lady Hartwell. Meanwhile, Lady Hartwell&rsquo;s sister Isabella falls for Francisco. To prevent their match, Lady Hartwell plans to leave London but is delayed when Valentine gets her coachman drunk. Their verbal sparring turns into mutual interest. Isabella secretly sends money to Francisco, who eventually discovers her identity and they confess their feelings. Similarly, Valentine and Lady Hartwell, initially at odds, begin to court and agree to marry.

Antonio is the nephew of Julio, who is feuding with Bellides, Ismenia&#39;s father. The men draw swords but are persuaded to part peacefully by Ismenia, who has fallen for Antonio. She invites him to court her, and Antonio is interested. Martino, initially cynical, decides to pursue Ismenia as well. The play introduces Franio, an old miller, and his family. His son, Bustopha, is a fat-clown actor miscast in a local pageant. Ismenia, Aminta, and Florimel, the miller&#39;s virtuous daughter, play goddesses in the pageant. During the event, Florimel is kidnapped by Count Otrante, who attempts to seduce her. Despite his threats, Florimel resists and uses psychological manipulation to repel him.

Ithocles, recognizing his wrongs and planning a marriage between his friend Prophilus and Orgilus&rsquo;s sister Euphrania, proposes to Calantha, who accepts, rejecting her cousin Nearchos of Argos. Penthea dies by starvation; Orgilus kills Ithocles with a mechanical chair just before Ithocles&#39;s wedding to Calantha. At the prenuptial banquet, Calantha, despite learning of the deaths of her father, Penthea, and Ithocles, continues dancing. Afterward, she condemns Orgilus, appoints Nearchos as her successor, and dies of a broken heart.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c5">&#39;Tis Pity She&#39;s a Whore</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;(1631; printed 1633): about the incestuous love of a brother and sister.

In a comic subplot, Horatio, obsessed with unattractive women, courts Fiametta but abandons her. Euphemia asks for death due to Farnese&#39;s loss of affection, and Ardelia mistakenly advises the Duke to comply. Euphemia is imprisoned with Leontio. Bentivolio returns, is hidden by Ardelia, and is later accused of betrayal. Valerio threatens Ardelia to sleep with him or he will expose Bentivolio.

At the wedding feast, a disguised masque reveals Luckless&rsquo;s mistake, angering Fitchow, who refuses to consummate the marriage. Constance falls into melancholy, and a series of deceptions ensue, leading Widgine to elope with the wrong Constance.

Blaze proposes a cure through Doctor Hughball and the mysterious nobleman Letoy. Letoy, a wealthy aristocrat with unconventional ways, uses a play within a play to treat the Joyless family&rsquo;s issues.

PLOT: Set in Sicily, the play follows King Gonzago, who, after being saved in battle by General Sforza, grows jealous of Sforza&#39;s popularity and imprisons him, replacing him with Petruccio. Gonzago then takes Sforza&#39;s daughter, Alinda, as his mistress and falsely accuses his queen, Eulalia, of adultery with Sforza, leading to Eulalia&#39;s exile. Courtiers Lodovico and Horatio respond differently: Lodovico is loyal, while Horatio is a sycophant. Eulalia, guided by a spiritual vision, becomes a healer in the countryside. Gonzago orders Sforza&#39;s execution, but Petruccio secretly spares him. Alinda&rsquo;s mental state deteriorates, and the king eventually regrets his actions, restoring Eulalia as queen. Alinda repents and retires to a religious life, while Gonzago abdicates in favor of his son and retires to a monastery.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2 c0 c1">MINOR WRITERS: </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c11">Thomas Randolph</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;(1605&nbsp;&ndash;1635) was an English&nbsp;</span><span class="c0 c1"><a class="c4" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poet&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1736319031415674&amp;usg=AOvVaw2MNTVQtkR_GCdZMl2M43R5">poet</a></span><span class="c0">&nbsp;and&nbsp;</span><span class="c0 c1"><a class="c4" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dramatist&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1736319031415765&amp;usg=AOvVaw0jg7Nb2N8K18-qD7V_ZRSs">dramatist</a></span><span class="c0">, recognised by his mentor&nbsp;</span><span class="c0 c1"><a class="c4" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ben_Jonson&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1736319031415892&amp;usg=AOvVaw2_kJ9w2s5_2gmNiuOeteEG">Ben Jonson</a></span><span class="c0">&nbsp;as being a promising writer of comedy.
